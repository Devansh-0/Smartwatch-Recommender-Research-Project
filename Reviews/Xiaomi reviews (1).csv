shivam tripathi,"Bought at 1600 after combing all offers, is a great buy.Better then noise, firebolt and all other sh*t.Got the heart rate monitored on a plastic bottle, which was great, although actual heart rate is also pretty accurate, so can't complain at this price.Better to go with Amazfit watches, Redmi watch series or a proper smart watch which will cost you over 3k, else buy a smart band, don't go just for dailing feature.Check the deal, if its good or not."
Nivya,"Looks - 10/10 , if you want to buy go for this watch I think it's a good deal if you specially want a watch which has less than 1.69inch dial then this is the one!"
shivam tripathi,"Apart from general tracking, used it for swimming and walking. Water resistance seems to be good. However, there are hitches in the swimming workout recording, hence 4 stars. Walking seems good."
Rajeshwari,"Pros:1. Monitors Sleep (idk how but it's really accurate)2. Perfect Heart Rate, steps and O2 measurement3. Notifications and Music controller is always a plus4. It measures stress and displays Weather data from phone.5. Auto phone unlock featureCons:1. No phone call notifications (I already knew that but it's said in the description)I have not tested its workout mode but GPS works fine. I've configured the watch to monitor everything every 30min and the battery charge is still 83%, Last I plugged it in was 2 days back. According to this rate, its battery is covered for around 10 days which is exactly what's mentioned in description. Overall, its really value for money and worth it!Haven't tested its water resistant though..."

Chander,                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†8 month using this watch best watch
Chander,Worth for 2k. Very accurate don't get cheated with other fake kids toys.
Dundappa,Very good product
Sachin Rathee,"I monitored sleep using it. For better review of this kindly check TheQuantifiedScientist youtube channel. For sleep this watch even beats many high cost watches and for heart rate honor bands beat high cost watches. Heart rate monitor is not very reliable and therefore i purchased meditive oximeter to monitor sleep. Please search on Google ourinnovativemind oximeter sleep test. For rest of things this watch is a winner. You get gps, compass and good quality material."
Amazon Customer,"Good product with far better accuracy with this price.I used mainly for swimming and it counts each lap well. But once screen broken, not gonna be water proof anymore.No in-built gps, needs phone all the time.Accuracy on terrain sports accuracy is better but not excellent."
shivam tripathi,"So has been using this for a couple of weeks.Things I noticed- Charge only lasts 3-4 days- Charges extremely quickly- Screen is pretty good (But you'll know that it's a cheap display, especially from certain angles)- Haven't really gotten around to use the trackers but the heart beat monitor seems to be working fine.- It's very useful when you connect it to your phone. It filters out all the calls from unsaved numbers (Truly a life saver for someone like me who gets in upwards of 200 calls everyday)- It's smaller than it seemsAll in all, its a pretty good deal for this price. Nothing too groundbreaking or anything. Just a smartwatch that functions fine."
Nivya,Touch response is not upto mark
Avanish Shrivastava,Less featured as this price go with other brand
bindesh,good
junish pv,First of all battery is draining like hell in one full cgarge it will go only 1.5 days with all the features on. Company says battery will go 10 days when it is in standby mode and all the features off. I dont know who will use a smart watch without its feature. Watch faces are very limited and very childish. Fastrack are good in this case.
Vishnu Ks,Gps is not working
Vishnu Ks,"Not accurate, erratic and bad interface. Better indian made fitness watches are available for much lesser price."
Masud Mallick,"Step count, Heart beat & spo2 tracking is good.  Battery drains in 2.5 days.  And app is so buggy.  Some data is not getting captured in-appUpdate: when i switched off all features and enabled only continuous heart beat monitoring. Battery stands for 7 days.Still app is not capturing data properly.  Eg. If I synch watch at 1 pm today, and sync on next day.  The data captured between 1pm to 12 am is missing.  Only next day data is captured."
Jitendrasinh Zala,"Overall, the Redmi Watch 2 Lite appears to be a solid choice for those looking for a budget-friendly smartwatch with a range of health and fitness tracking features."
saud,"This watch doesn't have calling features so mind it before buying, don't get scammed like me"
Avik PAUL,Good

shivam tripathi,I liked everything it was very useful I used for doing sports
Nivya,"Worst watch by Xiaomi.Scanning QR code on watch install Mi Fitness app which announces in Chinese. No solution provided by Xiaomi and service center.DO NOT PURCHASE IT.Persons who are using Mi band 5 will not feel much changes in feature. Only bigger display and mediocre performance SpO2 monitor is the difference otherwise Mi band 5 will be better than it.The Mi Fitness app is installed through third party website and not through Play Store (after6 months, Mi Fitness is now available at play store) . Some popups and advertisements are in Chinese language which is a major problem. Battery backup is only 2 days if we on Advance Monitoring option. My watch got switched off within 41 hours after full charge without use of GPS. Worst product by Xiaomi till date."

Sandeep Singh,Large and vibrant display helps to monitor multiple activities together. fit is also comfortable. Watch looks good in black color.
