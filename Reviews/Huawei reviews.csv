Factor,Good:App works with Iphone.Calls work on Iphone.Watch battery life is great.  I get 3 days or more.Style and look is great.Easy to use and operate.The sleep data presentation is great.Bad:Can't upload music to watch from Iphone. (android only)Sleep tracking is just ok.  The apple watch is better.I have tried several other non apple watches and they are all flops or way to expensive.  This is the only one I did not return. Keep in mind I am Apple person and old school (50+).If you want something that works and is more like a watch try this.
Malderdo,It tracks walking and exercise really well.  Need to try the sleep function tonight.  Overall gorgeous. Defenitley a mens watch.  Need to download the huawei app first then download the huawei health app. Little bit annoying.
Factor,"I love this watch.  It is a bit of a hassle registering it in the US, but worth jumping through the hoops.  Register it in the UK and not Canada.  For whatever reason when registering it in Canada it doesn't allow downloading new watch faces from the internet and you will be stuck with what comes stock.  Registering in the UK fixed that.  The battery life on this watch is insane!  We're talking 10+ days with all the features on.  Suck on that Apple Watch!  Heart tracking is super accurate for a smart watch.  Not to mention it just looks nice on the wrist."
W. Chen,I love this watch!
Bryan Grzywacz,"I don''t find any difference between the International version and normal version, but why the price is higher?"
Amazon Customer,Buena resolución Pantalla tactil nítida exelente producto encantado con la compra
Eng Guan Chua,efficient and does exactly as expected!! Im completely satisfied with my watch and the audio is quite loud.
Mauricio Espinoza Rojas,"Does everything it promises to do, looks great, and the sensors are pretty darn accurate. You might think black would look bland, but it actually looks pretty sharp on the wrist. I'd even say way sharper than the black leather strap. If you really wanna have fun, buy the watch with the moko 3 in 1 pack of straps"
Mauricio Espinoza Rojas,"This is a great smart watch and a real value at the price, BUT buyers in the USA BEWARE: You can not download the necessary phone app from either Playstore or Apple app store. Without it, the watch is useless. This was not disclosed by the vendor."
Dave,"Funciona muy bien de forma muy fluida.Lo unico malo que tiene es que la store no tiene nada util, pero eso ya lo sabia.Con lo que trae de base me es suficiente."
Tobi Moyela,Hasta el momento se ve bueno
Malderdo,"Compre este reloj pensando que era el nuevo modelo, y oohh sorpresa en la caja dice gt3 y adentro viene el gt2, sin cargador... Es una falta de respeto con el cliente"
Daniel Wetherall,"I was looking forward to using this watch since it had many great reviews and I was using another health monitor from Huawei. Unfortunately, there is no way to use this device in the US, since Google and Apple banned the brand from their app stores. You could scan the provided from the Huawei QR code but it will lead you to an empty store with no app because Huawei on their site excluded the USA as a supported region. I contacted Amazon to ask them why this item is sold in the US, and they apologized and told me to return it. So my review is to save your time and focus on another device."
Factor,Nive pack and very nice looking watch. I have to return as that was impossible to pair with my smartphone MI10
Malderdo,I couldn't download the app on my region
 ANGEL,"I've had two smartwatches before, one WearOS and one proprietary, and they each had substantial drawbacks. The Huawei GT 3 comes close enough to perfection (for my needs and wants - others' mileage may vary) that I don't feel any hesitation in recommending it (with the caveat below for U.S. residents). The screen is bright and sharp, the battery life is exceptional (I'm getting over ten days per charge without disabling anything except always-on display), and the UI is quick and responsive. Outdoors, it gets a GPS location fix within 15 seconds or so and accurately tracks my movements. There is an amazing quantity of watch faces, both paid and free, available. The speaker has adequate volume and surprisingly good quality, even extending to playing music acceptably.Why is it only ""almost"" perfect? For one thing, it charges relatively slowly - a couple hours for 0-100%. I can't just charge it when I'm showering, as I could with my previous watch; it doesn't get back to 100% before I want to put it back on, so I have to find times when I otherwise would have been wearing it to put it on the charger. Also, the app store is very lacking, only 32 apps at this point, most of which have little interest for the general population. (Two I would especially like would be a camera shutter app and a voice recorder.) Overall, though, I really love this watch.There's a special caution I need to give to prospective U.S. buyers: because of the Trump-era embargo against Huawei, Huawei does not provide service in the U.S., and that extends to app and watch face availability; those galleries simply don't appear in the Huawei Health app in the U.S. It is possible to get access to them on a U.S.-based phone, and it doesn't require advanced phone-hacking techniques like rooting or even enabling developer options. However, if you're not familiar and comfortable with techniques like loading APKs from non-Google sources, using a VPN, enabling a wifi hotspot, removing and inserting SIM cards, etc., or at least have a tech-savvy friend who can help you, this is probably not the watch for you. For me, though, having gone through the process, it's as close to perfect as I could ask for."
Sharon,affordable and with multi-functions
Victor Organa,I upgraded from a fitbit charge 4 to this watch.  Setup took a bit longer because huawei is a china brand.  A bit challenging but it works.  I was a bit disappointed I wasn't able to use the wallet pay.  But i really like how I can use the watch to take /answer calls and find my phone.  Which I wasn't able to do so with charge4.  The battery lasted for 1 week.  The sleep data analysis is more detailed. I can tell how efficient my sleep is.  It has a bigger clock face and makes reading time and messages much clearer.  Overall I enjoy the extra features on this watch vs charge4.  It's a keeper!
Viciu,"had this watch now for about 8/9 months. overall brilliant, tracks every thing i need includeing my steps, my sleep etc.The watch itself has a great screen, it clear easy to navigate all the options, i'm yet to purchase any other screen design ( theres alot of them available) as the free ones are good, so can change the design from more sporty relevance to more of a designer watch look for a night out etc. I think theres about 10 or so different free options.only negative point, not sure if its because i have the brightness turned up to full all the time or something else but the real world battery life is sadly not 14 days.  i would say 10/11 days though. I have been away with work/holidays etc since having the watch, once for 14 days, but was down to 10% on about day 10 or so.Thankfully I was able reverse charge the watch from my phone, I had checked before I left to save taking charging cable (doesnt take much room, but one less thing to worry about), obviously this wont be as quick as proper charger, but was sufficient to boost the watch till i returned home."
Aldo Barroso,"Thought I'd wait a while to write a review for the GT3 to see how I got on with it. After 10 months I'm still loving it and really happy I didn't splash out much more money for the Pro when this does more than enough to meet my exercise and life needs. The long battery life is a joy and since my phone is on silent most of the time, I rely on the watch for incoming call alerts. It was a mild faff getting the app off the huawei site rather than a play store but no problem setting things up on the phone. One of the best accessories I've ever bought."
William M. Miller,"This is probably the best watch i have ever had. it does everything that the adverts say. Once connected via bluetooth to your phone and the health app it gives all the information you could need, steps, heart, sleep, oxygen . Alerts you to incoming messages and calls. A lot of people get let to believe that these are for runners only but as a non running person this is just perfect. The menu of faces from free to pay for ones seems endless and will suit every taste. I would recommend purchasing one to everyone who wants a smart watch. By the way you dont need a Huawei watch to run the software."
joe,"O relógio em si é excelente, bem construído e funciona bem. Para integrar ao Google Fit, é necessário comprar o aplicativo Health Sync na Huawei Store."
Ong Lay Chin,Well made excellent choice of free watch faces from the huawei health app. You load your own picture from your phone gallery if you like. Takes calls and make calls via blue-tooth. Load and listen to music should you wish to. Cant make payments but who cares? A fine piece of craftsmanship.
steve barnes,"This is a seriously good watch - if you are really into fitness training/running, the training guidance is great the amount of activities you can track is super and the battery life if great compared to the likes of OS Wear or Apple watch.  The apps for oxygen, heart and sleep tracking are all good too.  Now comes the bits that aren't so great.  If you do not have a Huawei phone you need to download the health app via an apk then you have to provide loads of permissions.  If you are worried about privacy - that could be an issue.  The watch and app work well together providing the permissions are all given and that takes time.  You can now reply to messages with a small keyboard or there are quick replies, but you can't talk to the watch in the way you can with Wear OS or Sri.  The voice assistant on the watch will only work with a Hauwei phone and there is no NFC or WiFi on this model - I didn't have an issue with the WiFi not being there but I do like paying with Google Pay or Samsung Pay from my wrist.however, if you only use the watch for fitness and rely on your phone for replying to messages and using the watch to merely read them then this is a super purchase - I would recommend this just for the battery if you are not fussed with all the bells and whistles.Confession, even though I thoroughly enjoyed using the watch and its fantastic battery, well...................its just not that smart, if you want the ability to respond to a text or message by voice I would suggest the Samsung Watch4 or Ticwatch Pro Ultra for android and the Apple watch for ios.  Forgot to mention the bluetooth calling works well and if you use android you can transfer music in a round about way.  Final point whilst there is an app store on the watch - there are not many apps due to the USA banning Huawei from Google.  I think Huawei will get better and better and they will bring smarter features and apps like Spotify and Strava in the fullness of time.  However, for the cost of the watch I prefer a little more charging with more functionality.  Hey but you do you and if you are in the Huawei eco system its a very good compliment to go with your other devices."
Dave Baldwin,"This is my second watch in this range. Do like it but battery has not lasted more than 5 days. Not complaining as am happy with 5 days but a bit peeved that it does not last as long as advertised,"
Factor,Amazing watch! Hope long long time to be with. Many thanks!
Malderdo,"Flatly refused to pair and sync with Android (pixel 4a, android 12) phone. Health app is up-to-date from Huawei Appgallery. and pairs with existing Huawei Fit device with no problem. Watch is going straight back to AmazonUpdate: I later reactivated an old phone (Moto G8+) and found it would connect to this watch. While trying it out I noticed thst the Health app had just updated itself (to 12.0.10.315). With this new version, I could also  connect to the pixel phone.So,after trying it out for a few days the main claims - of improved HR and GPS accuracy - seem to be credible. I have compared the HR with a Polar Verity Sense armband and the GPS was 20m out on a 2KM walk (1% error).More generally, the screen is good and the touchscreen operation very smooth. In the UK, the choice of watchface is limited to the free set shown in the Health app but there are quite a few of them and I managed to find some that I liked.The Health app is similar to the Garmin Connect and the watch provides more or less all the measurements that are on the Venu 2 but at a lower price. As with the connect app, the data can be funnelled into Google Fit using the spearate Health Sync app.Thus I have rescinded my intention to return it and increased the star rating to 4."
Michael Singleton,I have the original GT watch for years and decided to buy this for my dad. The only pain is downloading the Huawei health app if your phone isn't Huawei. Easy for me but not someone who isn't great with tech. He loves the watch and can use it effortlessly now I set it up.
Ulisses Paulino,"A great watch overall, fantastic screen and features. Tracks running, HIIT and swimming really well (loads more activities incleded). The only issue is the sync with Strava missing. This can be over come with a separate app on the play store (one off small cost)."
richard jakimowicz,"I upgraded my GT2 to this GT3 both watches are amazing but GT3 just nicks first spot. Battery lasts just over 2 weeks with all sensors on 24 hours a day, however only lasts just a week and a bit if I use the music player that's built in for 40mins every day for 5 days.Build quality is great and the tracking seems accurate for me however I can not confirm if they are 100% accurate. I use this with a non Huawei phone and works flawlessly however there are some features that require a Huawei phone but I don't need them features.The only down side for me is the charging cradle, you can't use an after market usb type c cable as the cable is not detachable (if you need it to be longer) it is hard wired into the cradle."
Sammy J.,"Bought this to replace my Samsung S3 Frontier. Mainly to be used for fitness/activity tracking so was looking for good battery life, good screen and good gps. I'm not really interested in having NFC or being able to reply to messages from the watch. I can view all my notifications which is good enough for me. Also not bothered by lack of 3rd party apps, I always found apps to be generally poor when using my previous Samsung.Watch was easy to setup once correct version of Huawei health app was installed. I'm very impressed with the health app itself, easily one of the best I've used. I use Strava and had to use a third party app Health Sync to upload my activities to it. Tracking activities so far seems to be spot on and Gps signal is quickly picked up.Battery life seems to be excellent and close to what they claim, screen is bright and vibrant even when viewed outsidePlenty watch faces to choose from and the app selection is more than enough for me.Harmony OS seems to be really snappy and can only get better as they add more features and improvementsOverall really impressed and pleased with my choice. Spent hours looking at reviews and YouTube videos before going for this."
Mr. B. W. Healy,i rely like the watch and think it looks very nice and haze good battery life and nice fetchers the step counter is quiet good and i find the work outs mode good but i don't like the fact that you are restricted on apple (IOS) with the app you cant download music and updates take hours but i still like the watch and recommend it to others
Svetlana Kola,Great
Amazon Customer,Sleep tracking a bit off but everything else is brilliant
Tony,This is a great smartwatch but only buy when on offer you can save a small fortune. Payed about £145 for mine 😀
Philip Young,No problems with watch - works very well - use for running and GPS is very good with audible information at set split distances.Ability to take calls using watch very handy - can speak and listen to calls through watch with no issuesBattery life very good - lasts 5 - 6 days (includes a daily run lasting approx half hour)
Lord Farquuad,Wow! I am really surprised how amazing and functional is it! Is checking and tracking many health and activities aspects during the day and night. Smartwatch keep me control to always stay tuned with everything what is important because is handy.
Factor,Bought this as an upgrade from my GT2. I have been very disappointed. I'm lucky if the battery lasts 7 days and that's without using the GPS. The GPS takes ages to lock on compared to the GT2 and keeps dropping out. Am thinking of sending back and buying a new GT2.
Malderdo,"I only purchased for GPX Viewer unfortunately it's isn't great often looses signal doesn't assist with long trail runs when trying to follow route, I went back to navigating using phone and maps. But all other features previous watch had work a treat."
hairybanjo,"This watch is simply excellent, as good as any of the Samsungs etc that you see going for twice the price of this. Easy to use, easy to set up, can't recommend highly enough"
Izzysteinberg,All the features from the previous version are improved. Especially the heart rate monitor and the GPS accuracy and speed. More sport modes added and the welcome addition of the running ability index. The only negative note is that the sleep tracking although improved still feels a let down. Tracks the waking and sleep beginning much more accurately but the sleep cycles are still a miss half of the time.Other features were also included to match the competition but nothing innovative.The best fitness watch / app combo without a monthly subscription.
darren o reilly,cannot get app on my new HONOR phone
Del,Great battery life and apps can't beat it for your money .
war1ock1133,"Took a while to set up on my Samsung S20 phone but, once I had, I have been very impressed with performance and health tracking. Heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking and continuous spO2 tracking have been spot on. So far, very happy  with my purchase."
EUGENE MCCOOEY,A lot of gadgetsBattery life not a full 2 weeks
Ewelina,"Unboxing was nice, as the watch looked and felt really high quality.That's what I award the * for.After that, pretty much the whole experience was bad. Setup instruction are absolutely useless - one sentence in tiny font.Watch literally won't do anything until paired. So, you have to load the Huawei Health app, then add the device, which fails because the app needs updating.It downloads a new APK file and you are expected to set your phone up to allow installation of phones from other sources - so the new version does not come from the play store, and so is not tested for malware.After installing this new version, it still failed to pair, as it consistently failed to download the ""resource pack"".So, the Huawei software on a Huawei phone, can't pair with a Huawei watch. Useless. Wasted 2 hours of my time on this and finally sent it back. Shame, as the watch seems really nice.Off to look at Samsung instead."
D Studd,"Likes: Display, features especially live navigation from imported gpx file.Dislikes: Heavy and not comfortable for night wear. App (Android) no longer syncs with Google Fit."
Wes,"I bought  the Huawei watch for my husband's christmas, he likes it very much. He is amazed at the amount  things it does. It has encouraged him to exercise regularly. A perfect gift for him."
Gav,
Factor,Battery last at least 2 weeks and the watch faces can be changed very easily to show a totally different watch face. Brilliant bit of kit.
