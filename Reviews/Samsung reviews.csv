Reviewer Name,Reviews
C.R.M.,I bought this product for its features with my phone. The most important being the ECG which does not work correctly and is now useless to me.
mishqueen,I purchased this watch new. It arrived today and although it's a lovely watch I'm questioning if it's a brand new watch. There were no protective films on the screen or back sensor and the film on the charger looked like it had been taken off and put back on. Also it was dead.... never bought an electronic that was completely dead out of the box. I charged it to 100% and in the time it took to set it up the battery was at 80% (super concerning) and it had someone else's steps and health info on it. I buy everything new because hand me downs just aren't for me and I'm a little disappointed. Buyers beware!
Patricia V.,"Needed to turn off a lot of functionality to get adequate battery life. But at the end of the day, this watch is a banger. Looks great and is extremely functional."
Lindsie,Wish it came with a better user's manual to show how to use and add apps.
Lindsie,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Fits great on my small wrist, great battery life and tracks my steps better than my old Samsung fit.Was concerned about the white band but some alcohol on a cotton cloth brings it back to almost new.There is some slight discoloration at the clasp from wear so ill be ordering a black band but overall, very happy with my purchase!"
Gfam,I love this smart watch. I have not become as familiar with it as I want but I am learning.  It comes with no real directions but you are directed to a website.  I would purchase Samsung Galaxy smartwatch again. I also have a Samsung Galaxy phone so that factored into my purchase of this watch.
Pamela B.,"My wife and I both purchased this watch and we love it.  I'm in construction and really rough on everything.  So far it's holding up well, get a rugged case and you're good to go. So glad samsung went to wear os it's so nice that we have access to all the development."
Racheal,"Just got this yesterday. Bluetooth version. Seems very good. I have a Pixel 6 Pro, and as I understand it, I need some available hacks to get some health features to work with my non-Samsung phone. But I don't care very much. I bought it as a watch and for notifications and perhaps some phone calls. Phone calls seem fine. I use Google Voice as well, and the way I have that set up, I have to press ""1"" on the keypad to answer a Voice call. I CAN do this on the watch.It was on sale (price has already gone back up to around $200)."
Racheal,"I love this watch.  All the apps and options, all the faces you can use with the different designs and info you want on the face.  I like having the time, steps, weather and date on mine, but you can change it to so many other options whenever you wish.  This is the first smart watch that has connected efficiently to my Samsung phone without it being painful and I get all my calls, messages, calander events, absolutely everything on my phone.  I love the phone!  Here comes the BUT...and it's a big issue.!!!  The battery doesn't even last a day.  Maybe 20 hours, if you use the apps a bit.  What a pain.  I haven't decided what to do yet.  Because the other big plus for me is this is also one of the first smart watches, other than Fits bits, that doesn't use nickel or cheap metals in the watches that I react to and have to send back.  I'm highly allergic.  And Fits bit can never get their Smart Watches to connect to my phone and keep giving me the run around and telling me to call here and there.  But their batteries last FOREVER!  So inconvenient to charge a watch up throughout a busy day...any suggestions?  So sad about this, why can't they have a better battery on such a great watch???"
Betty,"This is my un-boxing review. Will add more input, after more time to use it.  Bottom line, it's nice size and weight, glass is responsive, two button operation on side is very intuitive.  I have been researching Smart watches, for a few weeks, looking for extra features like heart monitoring, sleep, and the basics like steps, etc.  I use a Kids GARMIN, so you know, I usually keep things basic, but functional.  Garmin is what all the runners recommend.  But, Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 kept popping up as having what I needed, with some nice extras, like text on the watch!  Then,  I needed to upgrade my phone, so the Samsung camera quality and price point brought me to Galaxy S22.  Which naturally led to an easy decision to get the watch as well, for smooth compatibility. It's nicer than expected quality.  The Galaxy Watch 4 (40 mm) is just the right size, as I have a smaller wrist, and the 44 mm would be too big!  The charger sits flat, and magnetic connection to the watch back is crisp.  It arrived about 45% charge.  I also spent $ on the Samsung charger plug, so the USB plug 15w, was a perfect match.  The phone with use the c connection, at 35w.  Samsung really is an upgrade, bit I was expecting less, and received more, when it comes to the watch!"
Collin m. Bean,Si dura el dia de bateria
Peter Jay,I love the watch.  Not fond of the fact that i have to charge it once every 24 hours or less!
Rebecca J.,"Apenas lo estoy utilizando y la batería no apenas dura un día y medio sin mucho uso, solo conectado al bluetooth del celular. En el apartado de sueño no creo sea tan certero como el Fitbit Versa que usaba."
CatsMeowMomma,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Very good watch is not only stylish but also helps you  to keep track of everythig like emails, messages, WhatsApp and more like your health, sleep and weather.All this connected with you cellular phone."
CatsMeowMomma,"I have used Android Wear type watches in the past and they were under powered in my experience, so I was a bit hesitant. I have also used an Apple Watch and been pleased with it. The Galaxy Watch 4 was at a great price and it has done very well. Battery life lasts all day for me and the watch interface is responsive with no lag. I think that the step count is a bit on the high side. The integration with Samsung apps is good as you would expect."
C.R.M.,Love the watch but the battery drains fast when you play with your watch to much
mishqueen,"I like the size, the band, the protectors exchangeable, the clock configuration, and .....I do not like is after the 3 months nobody can hear me when they call me or I call them.  Now I cannot return  it."
Lubdy G.,Easy to set up and use.
WillowMoon,I really like the watch but it don't even last 1 day without dying.
Isabel,"Been wanting one for a long time and when it went on sale during the holidays I jumped on it. Only con is probably battery life, which in my opinion isn't that bad. I have to charge it once every 24 hours for around an hour. Get some replacement bands for it when you order. The one that comes with isn't that great."
Deya E.,"Poca duración de la batería, cargarlo a diario"
Deya E.,"I needed a new watch, and saw this one which was on sale, so read some reviews..the one gripe was the battery, though most people said their phone has to be charged every day also. I bought the watch and have not been disappointed. It works really well, and yes, I do charge it when I charge my phone at night. I don't have any interest in wearing my watch when I go to sleep..so..I gave it 5 stars."
satisfied,"Poor product description. Ad indicates you can call and receive calls, but Samsung support says this model canot receive incoming calls. It would help if Samsung tech people provided feedback to the Q&A questions. They never do so and in many cases customer feedback was conflicting.  After several chats and calls to support I was unable to obtain the correct user manual.  You have to double tap screen or start button to get apps such as phone, which often doesn't work.  Instructions provided by their techs as well as in the Wear app indicate the phone app is either on the face or you slide down on the face to get apps, which may be the case on other Galaxy4 watches, but not this watch.  The delays and failures to bring up the phone is unacceptable when primary use is for medical alerts.  I gave up and returned two of these to Amazon."
zoe,Returned
lisbeth Howerton ,Like wearing your phone on your wrist except it doesn't have all your apps.
gopher101,Got this as an early Christmas present for my wife. Price had dropped with release of the V5 but technically the same watch. She loves it! Since this replaces a V2 she is already accustomed to charging while she enjoys her morning coffee so short battery life is not an issue.
MJ,I love this product.  I went from a fitbit versa to Samsung watch 4 and I love it! I went on YouTube and watched several videos comparing the product to the fitbit and Samsung watch 5. It's almost the same. Fits good in my wrist. I thought I wouldn't like the circle face from going from a fitbit (square face) but I really like it.
ML,Mom loves her new watch
C.R.M.,"After my Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 sustained water damage from less than a meter of fresh water, I had intended to purchase a Pixel Watch, Fitbit, or Garming smartwatch, but Amazon had a great deal on this 40mm Galaxy Watch 4 I couldn't turn down. I won't go into the positives too much, as there are numerous reviews talking about them, but it is far superior to the Active 2. The animations are smoother, the app compatibility is much greater due to using WearOS and not Tizen, the health features are better, and software support is until 2026. However, there are several negatives which I will list.First is battery life, which is about 36 hours with the always on display set to off and a non-animated dark watch face. This is pathetic considering the Active 2 lasted over 2 days easily with the same settings. This means you will have to carry the charger with you everywhere if you are going on an overnight trip, as it is not QI compatible with all QI chargers, especially Anker brand.Second is the watch faces. On previous Galaxy watches with Tizen OS there was a wide selection of free, nice watch faces. With the move to WearOS there are very few free watch faces, a good 99% have restrictions unless you pay, and due to the way WearOS treats watch faces, which are full-fledged apps, instead of just watch faces, app developers have access to much more of your data. Also, the number of included Samsung watch faces is few, even fewer than previous Galaxy watches. This negative will apply to all WearOS watches currently, however, but Samsung could have included a larger selection of first party watch faces considering the price of the watch. I will say that updates have added some new watch faces, like the Ball Watch Face, but it's not useful or desirable vs the kind of paid watch faces which have millions of downloads, and the Pixel Watch has many more included faces.Third is the watch band. This version is for S/M wrists, not M/L wrists. This is not listed in the description.If you can get this watch for under $140, and you don't mind charging it every day, and you don't mind using the included watch faces or paying for one, then you won't be disappointed."
mishqueen,I really like the features. I bought some silicone watch bands and the watch is very comfortable.
Tatiana T.,"Tengo un Smartphone Huawei y no sabia que no eran compatible, de haberlo sabido no lo compro... Pero el reloj está perfecto,solo ese detalle."
fiestylady,"I really love everything about this watch. It tracks my sleep, exercise and steps so well. I've also been entering my food and water intake to see where I'm at. It connects well to my Samsung phone through Bluetooth and you can even see the pictures you get by text on your watch. The sound is clear on voice calls. I like the option to voice record your text messages.The only downside is the battery life. It's just over 24 hours,  so you have to take it off everyday to charge. It charges pretty quick,  maybe an hour. But then you aren't getting an accurate report on the things you track."
Marge Daly,"I got the watch on a prime day deal so I thought for a discount I'll give it a try. I would never pay $300+ unless function and battery life gets better. The watch is useful but not needed. I use most for silent notifications when I get text messages and calls. It is nice to have an Google on your wrist. Health functions are neat but I question their accuracy.  Battery life is bad, 8-12 hours. Overall it's good smartwatch as far as smartwatches go. I would recommend for someone that's really busy and can't get to their phone for things easily."
Amazon Customer,"Overall, I like the watch. It has a lot of bells and whistles that eat the battery life. I am still attempting to narrow down exactly which apps I need to have running for better performance. The price was right so I went for the 4 instead of the 5."
Anatomy,"Samsung should of made a better battery for the watch "" ..."
Rick,Excelente artículo
Amazon Customer,"I love everything about this watch except for the battery life. I have to charge it at least every other day, even with only periodic heart monitoring turned on instead of constant. My old Fitbit was cheaper and only needed to be charged every 4 days or so, I really can't see why the battery life is so poor for the price. That aside, this does everything I need it to. I like the health features and the wireless payment is useful if I ever forget my wallet, which I seem to tend to do. I use the reminders and weather on this a lot and was able to get a shopping list app for it which is helpful. It could afford to have some better fitness features, like for instance most fitness trackers offer a daily readiness score, but this one doesn't. Only a minor gripe though, I'm quite happy with this."
Benjamin Langley,"Thus watch was a replacement for my older, heavier and bigger Galaxy watch. It was easy to set up and transfer apps from my previous watch. It is stylish and the battery lasts all day. Love it!"
Matt,"If you want to use the watch for anything other than steps and time, I get about 12ish hours before it gives a low battery warning. Would be 5 stars if had better battery."
Karen Friend,"I love everything about my Samsung Watch, it does everything I wanted and more !!"
C.R.M.,"I use this in correlation with my Galaxy S22+. I have not used the sleep feature as of yet. The battery life goes pretty fast so I would not leave on the Always On Display and at most only have it turned on when you flip your wrist. As for the features, it has a lot of apps that you may have on your phone and it can read texts and incoming calls as well. I wouldn't use this with an iPhone of course. You can set it up to show notifications if you're not wanting to take out your phone. I use it mostly for snapchat notifications."
mishqueen,Don't like the watch band it Sucks but if like you can buy a watch band of your choice 40mm size also keep brightness 🔆 low so battery will last longer this will not kill battery life. Enjoy your new watch.
Jean Luis Alcantara,I got this watch primarily for tracking gym and fitness stuff. Love it and all the options.
busy,"Overall, It performs pretty well. All the apps that are on it work fine. I have not figured out how to add more apps to it yet (apps that the watch itself says is compatible) The one big problem I have, is I have to charge the battery in the middle of the day. It charges quickly but doesn't stay charged even through a normal shift at work. I have changed some settings to make it better like turning some features off and it helps, but some of these features, like the heart rate monitor, are part of the reason I bought this watch in the first place."
busy,"This watch is awesome!! The only thing it doesn't do is make coffee in the morning. Joking aside, it gives so much feedback in a clear, concise, personizable way! I love this watch!!"
JBB,Llegó bien protegido en su caja original
Julia,Love everything about this watch except the battery.
Susan Maldonado,"Watch is great, I purchased 3 of them as Christmas gifts. I received good compliments and great feedback about them.I was happy to purchase them in a good deal cheaper than BestBuy & Samsung."
Carolina Garcia,"I'm accustomed to fitbit and absolutely loved the company before Google took over.  Since the takeover, I felt like I was replacing my tracker annually.  I'm a Samsung user, so the galaxy watch was very appealing.  So far, it does seem more durable.  I have had this product for nearly a year with no technical problems.  The battery life is awful compares to fitbit.  I have to charge daily and I rarely do more than wear it as a tracker.  Also, the app and interface are more difficult to navigate.  Fitbit is definitely more user friendly.  Not sure I get the big hype with the galaxy."
Jay,"I like the clarity of the screen, ability to read full text and send replies, and access phone calls! However, battery has short life."
Kindle Customer,"Tried to set up, but it wouldn't go any further than welcome.  I really wanted to use this watch, it sounded great."
April allen,It is last years model. I was wondering why so cheap.But it works good with my android phone and tried also with co-worker's iPhone as well.Feel though if they have bigger wristband made by Samsung to sell
heidi brickson,"I really love all of the features,  especially texts & fitness tracking,  but my screen is chipped up already. Get the insurance! Battery life varies depending on the features used.  I charge it daily."
C.R.M.,"I love this watch! Great style, functionality, battery life, size and tracking. I have not used the EMG setting because it requires you to download something, and I just don't have the space on my phone, but every other setting can be manages through Samsung Health and Galaxy Watch Manager. I had a Samsung Frontier watch that couldn't keep a charge, and this one goes at least 2 days before I need to charge it, and Is only because I have GPS tracking on it. I love that they got rid of the bezel, and now you can just use the screen- it cuts down on the bulkiness of the watch. I would 10/10 recommend this watch"
mishqueen,I had the previous galaxy watches/fit bit.. n everything worked as stated. The battery life sucked but still. So I felt like the galaxy 4 would be an upgrade. I was disappointed. The speaker to text doesn't work majority of the time. That's disappointing for me because it's how I communicate at work. The Bixby doesn't work either so I can't just tell it to call someone or text someone etc. The sleep tracker is ok but not very accurate. The mobile app have helpful tips but u can't do much on it. The battery life is GREATTT..  I work 12-13 hour shifts.. I have my Bluetooth connected the whole time because again it's how I communicate at work and when I get home I'm at 20-40%. I feel like that's a damn good battery life. I charge it before bed. I take it off the charger go to sleep.. wake up.. get ready for work and turn my Bluetooth on and leave it on and use it for 12-13 hrs and I still have 20-40% when I get home. Battery life is the best.. the rest wasn't worth the money.
DeathDemon,"Everything is fine except the battery, the app showed that it had 3 days left but it only lasted 8 hours at most. Even sometimes it turned off even with remaining baterry, I wanted a replacement but customer service only allowed me for a refund.I had the samsumg active 2 and that's why I know how to compare both smartwatches."
James Jazz Rodriguez,"I love this watch and the features like phone answering, text messages, etc.  It has a lot of features and many that I have not yet discovered.  The battery life could be a little longer but I have learned to put it on the charger first thing in the morning and then I am good for the remainder of the day/night.  The phone  feature on this watch makes me laugh out loud - almost like ""Dick Tracey"" and his watch phone from long, long ago!"
James Jazz Rodriguez,"The watch looks nice. I don't even have an issue with the band like I thought I would. It's comfortable, and the battery life isn't as bad as I expected from reviews. That being said I have gone through hours and hours of troubleshooting to try and get my messaging notifications to vibrate on my watch. I mainly got it so I wouldn't need to be tied to my phone. Now I feel really regretful about the purchase."
Misty,I'm admittedly a bit clumsy and have knocked the screen if the watch on hard surfaces a few times. Not even a scratch! The apps work properly and it tracks everything perfectly!
Erick Stanichowsky,"I've been an avid fitbit versa wearer since they released the first one. After 4-5 years, I wanted to try a new brand. I got the 40mm Galaxy 4 watch in silver with the white band. The band is SO THICK- not a fan at all. The watch face is also weirdly thick. You'd think for such a huge watch it'd have a better battery life.I charged it to 100% and put it about an hour before falling asleep. When I woke up, the battery had drained 23%. Just over night! The battery life alone is going to cause me to return the watch, but coupled with how big it and how uncomfortable the band is, I'm having a hard time wearing it.Pros:- integration with your phone for quick access to calls/texts- ECG monitor for those that like this- looks niceCons:- giant watch- giant band- I can't bend my wrist 90 degrees without first scooting the watch further up on my arm.- tiny battery life. so tiny.- complicated to use, even for a long time android user- so many apps/options make it hard for me to customize my watch- there isn't one 'health portal' to view steps, heart rates, etc. You need to navigate to the different watch apps."
Melissa B.,"I love my watch! It does a great job tracking my steps daily, which is important. Volume is good when answering calls or playing music. I really like the different exercises it tracks and counts as well. This watch is also helping me learn more about my sleep pattern and when I'm stressed. Would  recommend purchasing."
LUZ CELESTE ,"I will begin by saying that I am all things Samsung-appliances, tablet, phone. Naturally I wanted a  Galaxy watch. Love the way it looks and fits and capabilities are almost endless. That's where the ""but"" comes in as I am having to charge it about every 36 hours. My old off brand watch could last a week without a charge. Yes I do use it as a mini computer on my arm-mainly for texting and tracking my activity. I have used power saving mode and turned off a few other features and never listen to music. This quirk is not a good thing. Will I keep it? Probably."
kristin Talbert,Replaced an old Gear Fit that wouldn't last a full day. This one lasts 40-45 hours on a charge.
kristin Talbert,"Nice watch, I've had mine for about 6 months, still works as it should. I wish the battery lasted longer, I have to charge it once a day. Other than that I have no complaints."
hagagia,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Easy to set up and does everything that she needs.
Marcy ,Easy to set up and use
danerlu,"This is my first smartwatch, and I must say, I am thrilled.Tracking sleep cycles was something I wanted to do-- and my watch did not disappoint.Adding google assistant to this watch has become a life-saver when on the go.Still learning the interface, and love the customizable watch faces.Only downside is that in the first few days, charging the watch will be needed due to the watch learning your battery patterns.Definitely an amazing product."
C.R.M.,6k steps at work easy an this thing makes me feel like a slow lazy work day is hard. Battery life is ok. 3 days in an lowest I got by the end of the day is like 60%. Maybe if I was using apps heavy I'd have to charge halfway through the day but idk. Who spends all day on apps on a watch?? Maybe I'll update if this thing sucks in a month or two but for now it does its job. Prime day for the win.
mishqueen,"Watch mostly gets used to track my fitness on runs, but depending on the weather the same distance ran greatly varies day to day... Other than that I would recommend this watch, especially for the price."
June D.,Very nice
Ed Kimy,Easy to use.. Samsung delivered everything it offered for the watch. Downloaded the app to start the watch and everything is crystal clear on all the operations.. fast charging and I just charge at night and it lasts all day according to my activities... Thanks is in order
Cheri,Used with g watch wear app and wearable widgets app to get my CGM data on my watch. Works perfectly!
Cheri,Love this watch! It does everything! I am so very happy with this watch!!
V,
Tabitha,"It is everything I expected.  I waited until it went on sale, and I am very happy with this purchase.  It has good fitness features and the battery life is good for me.  Clarity is great with the telephone calls."
T. R.,This paired easily with my Android phone.  It is lightweight and easy to read.  My hands are a little big for some of the apps but a stylus works great.  I suggest watching some You Tube videos as tutorials for the watch.
Shirley Dein,"I purchased this watch for my wife  for Christmas, I received it on time in the original box very nice, my wife lives it definitely would recommend."
PrincessMeaniePants,"The watch is great, I love the compatibility with my phone. The battery will only last about a day, I have to charge it every day. The good news is that it doesn't take that long to charge, so I charge mine every morning while I'm eating breakfast and getting ready for the day and it's good to go until the next morning."
Caitlin,I think the watch is great and works wonderful with my Pixel 7 Pro. After wearing it for a couple days I noticed my arm looks burnt. It must be something with the strap. The watch itself left no marks just the strap. I sanitized it when I got it. Not sure what happened.Guess I'll have to try a new strap or return it.I really like the watch. Its very user friendly and one of the few watches with trip detection.But leaving a mark on my arm isn't ok. Hope it's just an isolated incident.
Riley,"The new OS on the watch is nice. It's easier to use and UI elements are larger and easier to read. The band that comes with it is pretty thick, but it's easy to change. The watch is slimmer and generally looks better than previous models. It has the usual pulse rate monitoring for working out and some ""gee whiz"" features like ECG and body comp. I'm disinclined to rely on them heavily but it will be interesting to see if the longitudinal data is of any value. Unfortunately, battery life is poor. I'm getting no more than 36 hours on a charge rather than the 3 days I was getting from my Active 2. If you buy this watch, plan to put it on a charger at some point most days."
C.R.M.,"Battery life is terrible, I had a fit bit before that I only charged once per week, and even with limited options turned on I have to charge this watch every 36 hours, or less.The sleep tracking is horribly inaccurate! I loaded photos, it is constantly thinking I'm taking naps even though I'm clearly awake. Just sitting still. And it won't let you edit those times at all. It's either delete or deal. Fit bit was super accurate. And was able to be edited if it did track wrong.Also it does NOT track walking if you are pushing a stroller, so you get no credit for walking, and it stops tracking if you sent move your arm obnoxiously.  I know some people say put it on your ankle, but that defeats the purpose of a watch.Needs some serious work."
mishqueen,Doesn't last long battery wise. Otherwise very accurate
KeKe,"make sure it has the functions you want. Battery life could be better, but it does charge quickly"
Retail Never!,I purchased this watch purposely because it had fall detection. I did fall and landed on the arm that the watch was on and fractured my elbow but the fall detection didn't pick up the fall and call my emergency contact.  Very disappointed. The battery life is not good either.  The EKG feature doesn't work with all phones.
Lori  J,"I do love the look of this watch. I had the Gearfit 2 before so I like the change in style. However, this one has to be charged every day which is highly undesirable and annoying. I'll definitely be upgrading from this one SOON."
Jamie Jo,So happy with my purchase. Works 100% so good and I love all the things about it
fortunate1,"Watched was a great product until it stopped working. Set it on the charger for about thirty minutes after it died. When I went to turn it back on the screen wouldn't come on, but I could tell it was on because it was vibrating for phone calls and messages. The backside looked like the battery leaked acid out.Being only 8 months old Samsung told me it was still under warranty and sent me to a repair shop about 40 minutes away, who told me that they cannot repair watches, which Samsung knows but sends people to anyways, and I'd have to send it to Samsung.The day Samsung received the watch they sent me a bill for $176 saying it was out of warranty. I called and they said it had liquid damage (if you google,many people have been told the same thing when it breaks) and was no longer powering on. The watch has never been in the shower or pool, only in rain which it is supposedly water resistant up to 200' of water. It also powered on before sending it to them.I argued with them and Mikayla in the repair department said they would have a second person look into it and call back in 48 hours. 4 days later I recieved an email saying the watch was being returned unfixed and I never received a call back so I called and was told it was set for exchange. Talked to someone in the case management department and they said the price was going to be refunded. I asked how long and they said once the paperwork it accepted, then asked me to confirm my contact so they could START the paperwork. They never contacted me to start the paperwork, so I'm sure they were hoping I wouldn't call back and are still trying to stall. They told me to call back if I hadn't heard anything by Thursday, so I will be calling then."
Tiffany,Although I have not learned all of the features of the Samsung watch I am really enjoying the sleep monitoring feature in addition to the step counter.
Veronika M,"Let me uninstall Bixby and use ECG without a Samsung account. I understand data is king but let me just use the hardware without the Samsung telemetrics please. It's a pain to have to root hardware just to get full functionality. It might be a good idea to get the blood pressure module approved before advertising it as well.Besides gating features behind an Samsung account, the hardware itself is well done. Fits my wrist well, band is comfy, and doesn't get hot at all. The heart beat, step, and blood O2 monitors are neat as well. Battery life isn't great (at 48% after about 8 hours of use) but I guess you can charge it before bed.I was looking forward to try the sleep analysis but it looks like snore detection is locked behind a Samsung account as well :("
Gorlack eater of worlds,Estoy muy decepcionada el reloj es muy lindo y todo pero la bateria parece de un reloj viejo no llega ni a medio dia sin darle prácticamente uso.
Joe Q.,excellent product
Amazon Customer,"Bought the watch so I could keep track of my heart rate and steps.  The best rate works pretty good,  I have it on continuous but sometimes when I look at it out gives me the rate from x minutes ago.  Steps matches pretty good.  Sleeping- the watch tells you your sleeping if you are relaxing on the couch, laying in bed watching TV.  My heart rate are wonky so that may be part of the reason it doesn't ready right.  My big issue is the watch seems to be burning my wrist.  I don't wear it in the shower and it doesn't get wet."
C.R.M.,"Very frustrated with this expensive watch, it started out tracking my GPS walks, and when I review my history, they are no longer there.  The history is there, but my GPS route is gone.  And when I walk, it does not track my GPS route and more.  I reset it, and it doesn't help.  I sent it in and they said everything was fine.  I got it back, it still does not track my GPS.  My son has the same watch, we set them both up at the same time. His continues and still tracks his GPS route.  Mine still does not.  That feature was one of the main reasons I got this watch.  And disappointed in the battery life, needs to be charged every night.  Would never get another Samsung Watch again"
mishqueen,This watch doesn't even hold a charge for a full day.  About 8 hours and that is it.  Disappointed.
Catherine Stephens,Easy set up and use. Clear sound quality on both ends of the call.
Gerry,"Compre el reloj, pero la bateia tenia muy bajo rendimineto, duraba muy poco la carga y lo regrese"
Gerry,I like it. It works way better than my fitbit. This watch has yet to track my sleep and the battery dies super fast.
Amazon Customer,It's a awesome watch but I do wish battery life was better.
Reika,Use the Samsung  health tracker all the time. Easy to use.
Reika,Comes in handy. Have had a couple of health issues and it helps keep me safe
Wanda,"Battery is horrible, could not even get through 24 hours without charging.  My Fitbit runs rings around it!  Disapointed.  All other features great."
Kindle Customer,Works as advertised no problems
Amazon Customer,Gift
Jennifer,Wife loves it
Ed Marmon,"Works great, have difficulty with the SPO2 feature, doesn't track consistently through night no matter how tight you have the band and seems to read low (recently bought a spo2 monitor only and it reads 10% higher through night than the samsung which is probably because it seems to have difficulty ready most all time not just of a night).  Have always had fitbit products in the past, wish the app was more user friendly like the fitbit app.  Also tends to have difficulty with the ecg readings, almost have to have your arm slightly damp to get any of these readings work (ecg, spo2, or body composition)."
Ed Marmon,"I use the watch with non-galaxy Android smart phone. The watch has good looking style. Overall, the functionalities are good. However, the most annoying bug is that whenever the phone went to airplane mode and turn off airplane mode, the watch won't reconnect. It will require user to reset (clear everything) the watch in order for it to reconnect to the phone. It might be a software bug but not sure if Samsung will cooperate with other phone company to fix this issue."
E. Thompson,"This is a very feature-packed watch. I'm not sure it's great for me, as, even with a large face, the features are so small that they are hard to read. Many offer the option of reading them on the phone, but then there is not much reason to have the watch!  The major disappointment is the very short battery life! It has to be charged every evening or it won't be charged enough through the night to monitor my sleep (which is important to me).  A lot of money for a fancy toy, I'm afraid!"
C.R.M.,"I'm in love with my Galaxy Watch 4. The battery life is decent but I can't go more than about 2 & a half days without needing to charge it but I charge it every night anyway. There aren't a whole lot of options in terms of cute & practical watch faces but that's okay. The heart rate monitor & ECG abilities are very handy. Seems to be pretty accurate. I also like that when I set it to ""walk"" it keeps track of my heart rate as I'm walking. You can track your stress level & it gives you ways to manage your stress. It has a TON of great things. Give it a try."
mishqueen,"This watch is great for texting, phone calls and my most important feature keeping track of my steps. The battery life didn't last as long as I would like it to but I can live with it. I have to charge it every night."
Adrienne,Fantastic in every way except the battery life.  My old galaxy watch would last almost 5 days per charge.  I'm lucky if I get 2 or three or if this one.  Even less if I have a busy watch face on.
Adrienne,"I was skeptical to buy this watch because it was refurbished, but I was pleasantly surprised. It arrived in excellent shape with directions. It has a long battery life and great call quality.  The features remind me when I have been sitting too long and actually tells me to get moving Well excuse me:) I am glad I decided to take a chance and buy this amazing watch."
Alicia Fox,Battery life  sucks maybe a day
warren,"I bought the wifi only version. I love this watch but there are some things it needs to improve. It's not very precise tracking runs (again this is the wifi only version, so I have no internet when I run), the body composition app just doesn't work, you need to install separate apps on your phone to get the full functionality of the watch, the battery lasts about a day so it's not so bad but not great either. I still love this watch and use it every single day"
Melanie F.,"Great, amazing watch and I haven't begun to learn all capabilities, just have to charge approximately every 36-48hrs, otherwise, it's amazing. It gets warm when charging but never overheats, once charged the watch and charger must disconnect to prevent overheating and overcharging-great attribute. Heck the band is so smooth and comfortable I don't know I'm wearing it. The speech to text is right on!!!"
T. Anton,My husband loves it
T. Anton,"The watch was OK. Setting it up for some things, like email, didn't seem to be worth the effort. They need some sort of very instinctive system for notifications. The real problem was the battery. I tried it with the screen on, but that was no good. Then I turned the screen off so you had to hit the power button. That seemed to push the battery to a day and a bit more. But basically it had to be charged every day. Then the battery life went over a cliff, down to 12 hours. I don't know what the deal was. The best thing was the fitness tracker. I got some information, but it was the same info you can get with an app on your phone. Now I was sending the data to the phone. There were two health apps, which is confusing. Trying to add something to a list was goofy. There's a system where you draw the letters, but it barely works, even when it is pretty obvious. But it didn't know an l from a 1, that sort of thing. The little keyboard was impossible. The voice typing was hit and miss. Doesn't seem fully baked. You buy these things, you get a month of frustration, and then you return them.  Anything you can do on your phone, and I have a Galaxy s21, you should do on your phone."
Brittany Davis,Everything about this watch is great for except the battery life.  Has to be charged daily.
Tony,Works. Got it in good time.
GNA,I LOVE THIS WATCH. IS MY FIRST NON Apple Watch
GNA,Not happy with battery life. Have to charge every day. Still learning all features.
Tom,"Love this watch, especially the GPS fall detection. Am still figuring out pairing to Spotify. I think it requires bluetooth earbuds to do it. Anyway, other features are great!"
Ana Iris Espinal,The white color bands suck. I clean it a lot and it still gets dirty and yellowish and even causes some skin irritation. But it was 50 dollars cheaper than the other colors so I'll just buy some aftermarket bands and a protector. The watch itself is like a 2nd phone. It uses almost the same gestures and apps. It connected easily to my Samsung TV and phone and only gets down to about 60% battery after a full day of use.
C.R.M.,It is awesome
mishqueen,Love this watch!
Leonbert Quintero,I love all the features however the battery life is terrible! Has to be charged 2x a day or more if really active. Think I'm going back to the Fitbit.
Christy Parrish,"This was my second attempt at a smart watch as the first one didn't fit to my wants too well but this one fits me to a t! The only problem I have is the battery life and the sleep tracking feels off sometimes. The battery life isn't the best really as you basically have to charge it everyday but that's not the biggest problem really. But in general, quite happy with my purchase!"
Christy Parrish,"Lots of amazing health apps! Battery lasts about 2 days. If new to smart watches you might have a tough learning curve, but so worth it!"
Cherylgirl,Battery life is great. Display excelleny.
Sherrie Knodel,I like the added apps. Waiting to upgrade to a galaxy phone to do the ECG... Only negtive I have is that the watch3 feels WAY heavier than the watch4-which could be a positive to some... It just doesnt feel a luxurious as the watch3. I didnt get the classic(with the bezel) but it has a bezel on the screen so i dont miss it at all. Still give it 5 stars (plus I got mine on prime day-so only $150! ❤
Judy Lehr,"I got this, one for my husband and one for me. Both used in like new condition. The price was awesome and got extra discount on Prime Day.They both look like new, have the Amazon Seal and come with original chargers and box.I think it's still missing more apps like the Apple Watch, but it's a great smart watch. If you're a Samsung user, this is a great add."
Rafael D.,"I really like this watch. Never had a wearable before but it's quickly becoming one of my favorite pieces of tech. I love that I can answer calls and texts very quickly. My calls are clear and fast. I love that it gives me more accurate activity info than my phone. It's also so nice that it looks and feels like a regular watch, and is super customizable. I'm in love!"
Stormy,"I like how lightweight it is, easier to use however doesn't keep charge for long, very frustrating. The app seems a tad confusing to use"
Coach Davis,It does a lot of what is advertised well. Needs a lot more Samsung made watch faces. Disappointed that you can't use the ECG app outside the US
Amazon Customer,"I really like the design. So far it's been easy to use. I was surprised at how short the battery life was compared to my old Blaze, but this has so many more functions. I charge it  while I'm doing dishes or watching TV, so it's always charged at night to monitor my sleep."
donna bridgmon,The battery lifespan is not good and now it is flickering.
C.R.M.,It literally tracks everything including how much you snore a night. When un sleep mode you want get woke up by the phone or anything.
mishqueen,I like the battery life and the way it works with my phone.
Amazon Customer,"What a great watch, but battery life truly is terrible.  It doesn't even last the day and that's with not having always on watch face and not checking it often. Really a shame"
Tom Janicki,                    The media could not be loaded.                 I like being able to choose the watch face.  Too soon to say what I dislike.  Waiting for granddaughter to show me more to do with it.
Amazon Customer,I love everything about my watch. I think I just need to put some apps to sleep to help with the battery life.
Anthony Burkett,I have only had it for a week and so far I love the watch. It's a tremendous upgrade from my active 2...
JKaufmann,"First of all, let me just say I'm comparing this watch to an Apple Watch.  Not really much comparison, Apple has it hands down.  I recently switched to a Samsung Phone.  I like the phone, but strongly dislike the watch.  The range to the phone has to be so close, why even bother . . . This morning I was on the elliptical machine for a little over a mile (30 minutes) and I just noticed a little while ago my watch said 531 steps.  How can that be??? My apple watch gave me credit for a workout and it counted towards my steps.  This watch isn't as user friendly as the Apple watch either.  Oh, and I didn't rate the sleep tracking because I've never used it, so can't say if it's good or bad for that.  For those who are looking for something comparable to the Apple Watch, this watch isn't for you.  For those who have never had an Apple watch, maybe this will work for you, not sure."
Honest User,I like the watch well enough but I have it so limited on what it can do to save battery life and it still drains fast. My fitbit did more and the battery didn't drain need to be charged so often. Very disappointed in that.
Amazon Customer,"It is great and does all that us needed. But only lasts a day. Then the battery is dead. So when using for. Whole day, it doesn't  get the chance to track my sleep. Unless you charge it right before bed"
Jessica W.,"I'm very happy with my Galaxy watch. Battery life is good, it's easy to talk into for calls, and was super simple to set up. I wpild definitely recommend!"
Jessica W.,This watch provides fall protection  which is the main feature I wan ted.
Rocci,Watch is working well after 3 weeks. Charge can last two days. More apps needed to be 5 stars.
Samantha Haba ,"Figured by now the censor for the heart rate could have been upgraded enough to not hate my tattoos.  Alas, that feature is generally useless."
C.R.M.,"Battery does not last even 8h on standby (only turning on the screen when I raise my arm to check the time). And this is how much it lasted the first time I used it (shortly after I bought it and after fully charging it).Nevertheless, the watch looks nice, waistband fits well and is comfortable."
mishqueen,"Honestly this is a great watch. It does everything I need it to and I primarily use it to monitor my heart rate, sleep tracking, and texting and calling. The only issue I have is with the battery life and that I have to use a wireless charger with it instead of being able to plug it in like I have with my Apple watch."
Yvette Butler,"I was quite excited to upgrade to a fancier version of my Galaxy Fit. And at first everything seemed great. I did buy more comfortable bands from Etsy, but even that didn't help much. And I thought the battery life would be okay, but compared to the Fit, it was awful. And if it's going to track sleep, why would I want to charge it every night? I will say that it seemed to charge very fast.It didn't seem to track my walking very well, at least automatically. It would start very late. I didn't care because I use an app on my phone for that.I didn't learn much about the functionality, since I did return it. I decided to return it the day I had it charged it to 100%, then it did an update, and when I went to check the weather the phone was off. I tried to turn it on and discovered it was dead. Since it uses a proprietary charger and I was at work, I had to just wear a dead watch all day.I could probably deal with the comfort by finding the right band, but the battery life is too terrible for something this expensive."
Shakeya,My son bought this with his first paycheck and totally loves it. Best purchase he has made yet and at a great price.
Amazon Customer,"It's been disappointing from day one of getting this watch. As a galaxy phone user, I decided to upgrade from a 7 year old watch to this, thinking it can only be better. I was so wrong... Bugs that I've noticed so far:1. Always on display is dim, so when running outside in the sun you can't see anything. There's no way to make it brighter, you have to touch the watch/raise wrist to turn it back on, rendering AOD worthless2. GPS is slow and inaccurate. Example: running 100m sprints, according to the watch, my top speed was 10mph - yes, 10!!! This is my max out of 8 x 100m sprints. I run 10k at 10mph pace.3. There is no heart rate zone training in the app. Old watch has it4. Can't adjust your heart rate zones. My maximum heart rate is much higher than the watch has by default which makes all of my zones wrong. My old watch can be adjusted5. My old watch has a mode where you race vs your  previous run. Not GW46. It loses my heart rate all the time when using 'Other workout'One more thing, Samsung health app shows a graph of your workout with time on the X axis. However, you can't tell what exact minute and second the point on the graph refers to. It'd be great to be able to see that (needless to say, my 7 year old watch has that functionality).I was thinking about returning the watch from the beginning but was trying to find solutions to those issues. Now my 30 days are over and it seems these are the worst 150 bucks I've ever spent. Samsung just seem to be a decade behind true sports watch companies. I'll try to get rid of this and get a Pilar/Fitbit/etc., I know those work as they are supposed to. I do NOT recommend this watch"
Andi,"This is my third Galazy watch and it's my favorite!  I've got a Galaxy Watch 3 Classic and Galaxy Active.  To me it's faster and easier to use than the Watch 3.  I love being able to customize the watch face with a picture of my dog!  I'm not crazy about the battery life, I like to have the watch always on, but I've got two other watches to wear when this needs charging.  I can usually get 8 - 12 hours out of a charge and would get more if I didn't have it in the ""always on"" mode, but it's the look that I like.  Not sorry I bought this, it's a beautiful watch."
Andi,"Once again Samsung provides a terrible experience. While there's the usual things like Samsung apps you can't disable or get rid of, it has an absolutely terrible user experience. Several times, after rebooting my phone (Pixel 7) the watch failed to reconnect and would have to be reset as if I was connecting to a new phone (that it has to reset to connect to a new phone instead of checking if you're signed into a Samsung account on a new device and just connecting is terrible on its own). Then when I would go to restore my old settings from the cloud backup, it would say the restore was successful but nothing would change on the watch. So what's the point of this function if it doesn't actually restore anything? Poor experience and once again proves that Samsung isn't worth the effort."
Abrilla Ruiz,Realmente el producto está bueno y no tiene nada que envidiarle a la quinta generación si aún puedes conseguirlo a un precio módico. Yo compre el 4 días antes de que presentaran el 5 y no me arrepiento.
George,"the battery requires charging at least daily, sometimes twice daily. I have followed the recommendations for preserving battery life with little effect.  What is the point of having the features on the watch if you have to turn them off to get any battery life?"
Steve,It's ok
Steve Scott Chastain,Good product
Brunoski,"Tracks my steps, sleep, heart rate, and the weather even. Even tells me when I am stressed and need to breath. Water proof. Battery life has been great. Easy to connect to phone and or ear buds. Can play your music, talk, and text on it as well. I love it. Sleek and durable band."
,
C.R.M.,I bought this product for its features with my phone. The most important being the ECG which does not work correctly and is now useless to me.
mishqueen,I purchased this watch new. It arrived today and although it's a lovely watch I'm questioning if it's a brand new watch. There were no protective films on the screen or back sensor and the film on the charger looked like it had been taken off and put back on. Also it was dead.... never bought an electronic that was completely dead out of the box. I charged it to 100% and in the time it took to set it up the battery was at 80% (super concerning) and it had someone else's steps and health info on it. I buy everything new because hand me downs just aren't for me and I'm a little disappointed. Buyers beware!
Patricia V.,"Needed to turn off a lot of functionality to get adequate battery life. But at the end of the day, this watch is a banger. Looks great and is extremely functional."
Lindsie,Wish it came with a better user's manual to show how to use and add apps.
Lindsie,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Fits great on my small wrist, great battery life and tracks my steps better than my old Samsung fit.Was concerned about the white band but some alcohol on a cotton cloth brings it back to almost new.There is some slight discoloration at the clasp from wear so ill be ordering a black band but overall, very happy with my purchase!"
Gfam,I love this smart watch. I have not become as familiar with it as I want but I am learning.  It comes with no real directions but you are directed to a website.  I would purchase Samsung Galaxy smartwatch again. I also have a Samsung Galaxy phone so that factored into my purchase of this watch.
Pamela B.,"My wife and I both purchased this watch and we love it.  I'm in construction and really rough on everything.  So far it's holding up well, get a rugged case and you're good to go. So glad samsung went to wear os it's so nice that we have access to all the development."
Racheal,"Just got this yesterday. Bluetooth version. Seems very good. I have a Pixel 6 Pro, and as I understand it, I need some available hacks to get some health features to work with my non-Samsung phone. But I don't care very much. I bought it as a watch and for notifications and perhaps some phone calls. Phone calls seem fine. I use Google Voice as well, and the way I have that set up, I have to press ""1"" on the keypad to answer a Voice call. I CAN do this on the watch.It was on sale (price has already gone back up to around $200)."
Racheal,"I love this watch.  All the apps and options, all the faces you can use with the different designs and info you want on the face.  I like having the time, steps, weather and date on mine, but you can change it to so many other options whenever you wish.  This is the first smart watch that has connected efficiently to my Samsung phone without it being painful and I get all my calls, messages, calander events, absolutely everything on my phone.  I love the phone!  Here comes the BUT...and it's a big issue.!!!  The battery doesn't even last a day.  Maybe 20 hours, if you use the apps a bit.  What a pain.  I haven't decided what to do yet.  Because the other big plus for me is this is also one of the first smart watches, other than Fits bits, that doesn't use nickel or cheap metals in the watches that I react to and have to send back.  I'm highly allergic.  And Fits bit can never get their Smart Watches to connect to my phone and keep giving me the run around and telling me to call here and there.  But their batteries last FOREVER!  So inconvenient to charge a watch up throughout a busy day...any suggestions?  So sad about this, why can't they have a better battery on such a great watch???"
Betty,"This is my un-boxing review. Will add more input, after more time to use it.  Bottom line, it's nice size and weight, glass is responsive, two button operation on side is very intuitive.  I have been researching Smart watches, for a few weeks, looking for extra features like heart monitoring, sleep, and the basics like steps, etc.  I use a Kids GARMIN, so you know, I usually keep things basic, but functional.  Garmin is what all the runners recommend.  But, Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 kept popping up as having what I needed, with some nice extras, like text on the watch!  Then,  I needed to upgrade my phone, so the Samsung camera quality and price point brought me to Galaxy S22.  Which naturally led to an easy decision to get the watch as well, for smooth compatibility. It's nicer than expected quality.  The Galaxy Watch 4 (40 mm) is just the right size, as I have a smaller wrist, and the 44 mm would be too big!  The charger sits flat, and magnetic connection to the watch back is crisp.  It arrived about 45% charge.  I also spent $ on the Samsung charger plug, so the USB plug 15w, was a perfect match.  The phone with use the c connection, at 35w.  Samsung really is an upgrade, bit I was expecting less, and received more, when it comes to the watch!"
Collin m. Bean,Si dura el dia de bateria
Peter Jay,I love the watch.  Not fond of the fact that i have to charge it once every 24 hours or less!
Rebecca J.,"Apenas lo estoy utilizando y la batería no apenas dura un día y medio sin mucho uso, solo conectado al bluetooth del celular. En el apartado de sueño no creo sea tan certero como el Fitbit Versa que usaba."
CatsMeowMomma,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Very good watch is not only stylish but also helps you  to keep track of everythig like emails, messages, WhatsApp and more like your health, sleep and weather.All this connected with you cellular phone."
CatsMeowMomma,"I have used Android Wear type watches in the past and they were under powered in my experience, so I was a bit hesitant. I have also used an Apple Watch and been pleased with it. The Galaxy Watch 4 was at a great price and it has done very well. Battery life lasts all day for me and the watch interface is responsive with no lag. I think that the step count is a bit on the high side. The integration with Samsung apps is good as you would expect."
C.R.M.,Love the watch but the battery drains fast when you play with your watch to much
mishqueen,"I like the size, the band, the protectors exchangeable, the clock configuration, and .....I do not like is after the 3 months nobody can hear me when they call me or I call them.  Now I cannot return  it."
Lubdy G.,Easy to set up and use.
WillowMoon,I really like the watch but it don't even last 1 day without dying.
Isabel,"Been wanting one for a long time and when it went on sale during the holidays I jumped on it. Only con is probably battery life, which in my opinion isn't that bad. I have to charge it once every 24 hours for around an hour. Get some replacement bands for it when you order. The one that comes with isn't that great."
Deya E.,"Poca duración de la batería, cargarlo a diario"
Deya E.,"I needed a new watch, and saw this one which was on sale, so read some reviews..the one gripe was the battery, though most people said their phone has to be charged every day also. I bought the watch and have not been disappointed. It works really well, and yes, I do charge it when I charge my phone at night. I don't have any interest in wearing my watch when I go to sleep..so..I gave it 5 stars."
satisfied,"Poor product description. Ad indicates you can call and receive calls, but Samsung support says this model canot receive incoming calls. It would help if Samsung tech people provided feedback to the Q&A questions. They never do so and in many cases customer feedback was conflicting.  After several chats and calls to support I was unable to obtain the correct user manual.  You have to double tap screen or start button to get apps such as phone, which often doesn't work.  Instructions provided by their techs as well as in the Wear app indicate the phone app is either on the face or you slide down on the face to get apps, which may be the case on other Galaxy4 watches, but not this watch.  The delays and failures to bring up the phone is unacceptable when primary use is for medical alerts.  I gave up and returned two of these to Amazon."
zoe,Returned
lisbeth Howerton ,Like wearing your phone on your wrist except it doesn't have all your apps.
gopher101,Got this as an early Christmas present for my wife. Price had dropped with release of the V5 but technically the same watch. She loves it! Since this replaces a V2 she is already accustomed to charging while she enjoys her morning coffee so short battery life is not an issue.
MJ,I love this product.  I went from a fitbit versa to Samsung watch 4 and I love it! I went on YouTube and watched several videos comparing the product to the fitbit and Samsung watch 5. It's almost the same. Fits good in my wrist. I thought I wouldn't like the circle face from going from a fitbit (square face) but I really like it.
ML,Mom loves her new watch
C.R.M.,"After my Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 sustained water damage from less than a meter of fresh water, I had intended to purchase a Pixel Watch, Fitbit, or Garming smartwatch, but Amazon had a great deal on this 40mm Galaxy Watch 4 I couldn't turn down. I won't go into the positives too much, as there are numerous reviews talking about them, but it is far superior to the Active 2. The animations are smoother, the app compatibility is much greater due to using WearOS and not Tizen, the health features are better, and software support is until 2026. However, there are several negatives which I will list.First is battery life, which is about 36 hours with the always on display set to off and a non-animated dark watch face. This is pathetic considering the Active 2 lasted over 2 days easily with the same settings. This means you will have to carry the charger with you everywhere if you are going on an overnight trip, as it is not QI compatible with all QI chargers, especially Anker brand.Second is the watch faces. On previous Galaxy watches with Tizen OS there was a wide selection of free, nice watch faces. With the move to WearOS there are very few free watch faces, a good 99% have restrictions unless you pay, and due to the way WearOS treats watch faces, which are full-fledged apps, instead of just watch faces, app developers have access to much more of your data. Also, the number of included Samsung watch faces is few, even fewer than previous Galaxy watches. This negative will apply to all WearOS watches currently, however, but Samsung could have included a larger selection of first party watch faces considering the price of the watch. I will say that updates have added some new watch faces, like the Ball Watch Face, but it's not useful or desirable vs the kind of paid watch faces which have millions of downloads, and the Pixel Watch has many more included faces.Third is the watch band. This version is for S/M wrists, not M/L wrists. This is not listed in the description.If you can get this watch for under $140, and you don't mind charging it every day, and you don't mind using the included watch faces or paying for one, then you won't be disappointed."
mishqueen,I really like the features. I bought some silicone watch bands and the watch is very comfortable.
Tatiana T.,"Tengo un Smartphone Huawei y no sabia que no eran compatible, de haberlo sabido no lo compro... Pero el reloj está perfecto,solo ese detalle."
fiestylady,"I really love everything about this watch. It tracks my sleep, exercise and steps so well. I've also been entering my food and water intake to see where I'm at. It connects well to my Samsung phone through Bluetooth and you can even see the pictures you get by text on your watch. The sound is clear on voice calls. I like the option to voice record your text messages.The only downside is the battery life. It's just over 24 hours,  so you have to take it off everyday to charge. It charges pretty quick,  maybe an hour. But then you aren't getting an accurate report on the things you track."
Marge Daly,"I got the watch on a prime day deal so I thought for a discount I'll give it a try. I would never pay $300+ unless function and battery life gets better. The watch is useful but not needed. I use most for silent notifications when I get text messages and calls. It is nice to have an Google on your wrist. Health functions are neat but I question their accuracy.  Battery life is bad, 8-12 hours. Overall it's good smartwatch as far as smartwatches go. I would recommend for someone that's really busy and can't get to their phone for things easily."
Amazon Customer,"Overall, I like the watch. It has a lot of bells and whistles that eat the battery life. I am still attempting to narrow down exactly which apps I need to have running for better performance. The price was right so I went for the 4 instead of the 5."
Anatomy,"Samsung should of made a better battery for the watch "" ..."
Rick,Excelente artículo
Amazon Customer,"I love everything about this watch except for the battery life. I have to charge it at least every other day, even with only periodic heart monitoring turned on instead of constant. My old Fitbit was cheaper and only needed to be charged every 4 days or so, I really can't see why the battery life is so poor for the price. That aside, this does everything I need it to. I like the health features and the wireless payment is useful if I ever forget my wallet, which I seem to tend to do. I use the reminders and weather on this a lot and was able to get a shopping list app for it which is helpful. It could afford to have some better fitness features, like for instance most fitness trackers offer a daily readiness score, but this one doesn't. Only a minor gripe though, I'm quite happy with this."
Benjamin Langley,"Thus watch was a replacement for my older, heavier and bigger Galaxy watch. It was easy to set up and transfer apps from my previous watch. It is stylish and the battery lasts all day. Love it!"
Matt,"If you want to use the watch for anything other than steps and time, I get about 12ish hours before it gives a low battery warning. Would be 5 stars if had better battery."
Karen Friend,"I love everything about my Samsung Watch, it does everything I wanted and more !!"
C.R.M.,"I use this in correlation with my Galaxy S22+. I have not used the sleep feature as of yet. The battery life goes pretty fast so I would not leave on the Always On Display and at most only have it turned on when you flip your wrist. As for the features, it has a lot of apps that you may have on your phone and it can read texts and incoming calls as well. I wouldn't use this with an iPhone of course. You can set it up to show notifications if you're not wanting to take out your phone. I use it mostly for snapchat notifications."
mishqueen,Don't like the watch band it Sucks but if like you can buy a watch band of your choice 40mm size also keep brightness 🔆 low so battery will last longer this will not kill battery life. Enjoy your new watch.
Jean Luis Alcantara,I got this watch primarily for tracking gym and fitness stuff. Love it and all the options.
busy,"Overall, It performs pretty well. All the apps that are on it work fine. I have not figured out how to add more apps to it yet (apps that the watch itself says is compatible) The one big problem I have, is I have to charge the battery in the middle of the day. It charges quickly but doesn't stay charged even through a normal shift at work. I have changed some settings to make it better like turning some features off and it helps, but some of these features, like the heart rate monitor, are part of the reason I bought this watch in the first place."
busy,"This watch is awesome!! The only thing it doesn't do is make coffee in the morning. Joking aside, it gives so much feedback in a clear, concise, personizable way! I love this watch!!"
JBB,Llegó bien protegido en su caja original
Julia,Love everything about this watch except the battery.
Susan Maldonado,"Watch is great, I purchased 3 of them as Christmas gifts. I received good compliments and great feedback about them.I was happy to purchase them in a good deal cheaper than BestBuy & Samsung."
Carolina Garcia,"I'm accustomed to fitbit and absolutely loved the company before Google took over.  Since the takeover, I felt like I was replacing my tracker annually.  I'm a Samsung user, so the galaxy watch was very appealing.  So far, it does seem more durable.  I have had this product for nearly a year with no technical problems.  The battery life is awful compares to fitbit.  I have to charge daily and I rarely do more than wear it as a tracker.  Also, the app and interface are more difficult to navigate.  Fitbit is definitely more user friendly.  Not sure I get the big hype with the galaxy."
Jay,"I like the clarity of the screen, ability to read full text and send replies, and access phone calls! However, battery has short life."
Kindle Customer,"Tried to set up, but it wouldn't go any further than welcome.  I really wanted to use this watch, it sounded great."
April allen,It is last years model. I was wondering why so cheap.But it works good with my android phone and tried also with co-worker's iPhone as well.Feel though if they have bigger wristband made by Samsung to sell
heidi brickson,"I really love all of the features,  especially texts & fitness tracking,  but my screen is chipped up already. Get the insurance! Battery life varies depending on the features used.  I charge it daily."
C.R.M.,"I love this watch! Great style, functionality, battery life, size and tracking. I have not used the EMG setting because it requires you to download something, and I just don't have the space on my phone, but every other setting can be manages through Samsung Health and Galaxy Watch Manager. I had a Samsung Frontier watch that couldn't keep a charge, and this one goes at least 2 days before I need to charge it, and Is only because I have GPS tracking on it. I love that they got rid of the bezel, and now you can just use the screen- it cuts down on the bulkiness of the watch. I would 10/10 recommend this watch"
mishqueen,I had the previous galaxy watches/fit bit.. n everything worked as stated. The battery life sucked but still. So I felt like the galaxy 4 would be an upgrade. I was disappointed. The speaker to text doesn't work majority of the time. That's disappointing for me because it's how I communicate at work. The Bixby doesn't work either so I can't just tell it to call someone or text someone etc. The sleep tracker is ok but not very accurate. The mobile app have helpful tips but u can't do much on it. The battery life is GREATTT..  I work 12-13 hour shifts.. I have my Bluetooth connected the whole time because again it's how I communicate at work and when I get home I'm at 20-40%. I feel like that's a damn good battery life. I charge it before bed. I take it off the charger go to sleep.. wake up.. get ready for work and turn my Bluetooth on and leave it on and use it for 12-13 hrs and I still have 20-40% when I get home. Battery life is the best.. the rest wasn't worth the money.
DeathDemon,"Everything is fine except the battery, the app showed that it had 3 days left but it only lasted 8 hours at most. Even sometimes it turned off even with remaining baterry, I wanted a replacement but customer service only allowed me for a refund.I had the samsumg active 2 and that's why I know how to compare both smartwatches."
James Jazz Rodriguez,"I love this watch and the features like phone answering, text messages, etc.  It has a lot of features and many that I have not yet discovered.  The battery life could be a little longer but I have learned to put it on the charger first thing in the morning and then I am good for the remainder of the day/night.  The phone  feature on this watch makes me laugh out loud - almost like ""Dick Tracey"" and his watch phone from long, long ago!"
James Jazz Rodriguez,"The watch looks nice. I don't even have an issue with the band like I thought I would. It's comfortable, and the battery life isn't as bad as I expected from reviews. That being said I have gone through hours and hours of troubleshooting to try and get my messaging notifications to vibrate on my watch. I mainly got it so I wouldn't need to be tied to my phone. Now I feel really regretful about the purchase."
Misty,I'm admittedly a bit clumsy and have knocked the screen if the watch on hard surfaces a few times. Not even a scratch! The apps work properly and it tracks everything perfectly!
Erick Stanichowsky,"I've been an avid fitbit versa wearer since they released the first one. After 4-5 years, I wanted to try a new brand. I got the 40mm Galaxy 4 watch in silver with the white band. The band is SO THICK- not a fan at all. The watch face is also weirdly thick. You'd think for such a huge watch it'd have a better battery life.I charged it to 100% and put it about an hour before falling asleep. When I woke up, the battery had drained 23%. Just over night! The battery life alone is going to cause me to return the watch, but coupled with how big it and how uncomfortable the band is, I'm having a hard time wearing it.Pros:- integration with your phone for quick access to calls/texts- ECG monitor for those that like this- looks niceCons:- giant watch- giant band- I can't bend my wrist 90 degrees without first scooting the watch further up on my arm.- tiny battery life. so tiny.- complicated to use, even for a long time android user- so many apps/options make it hard for me to customize my watch- there isn't one 'health portal' to view steps, heart rates, etc. You need to navigate to the different watch apps."
Melissa B.,"I love my watch! It does a great job tracking my steps daily, which is important. Volume is good when answering calls or playing music. I really like the different exercises it tracks and counts as well. This watch is also helping me learn more about my sleep pattern and when I'm stressed. Would  recommend purchasing."
LUZ CELESTE ,"I will begin by saying that I am all things Samsung-appliances, tablet, phone. Naturally I wanted a  Galaxy watch. Love the way it looks and fits and capabilities are almost endless. That's where the ""but"" comes in as I am having to charge it about every 36 hours. My old off brand watch could last a week without a charge. Yes I do use it as a mini computer on my arm-mainly for texting and tracking my activity. I have used power saving mode and turned off a few other features and never listen to music. This quirk is not a good thing. Will I keep it? Probably."
kristin Talbert,Replaced an old Gear Fit that wouldn't last a full day. This one lasts 40-45 hours on a charge.
kristin Talbert,"Nice watch, I've had mine for about 6 months, still works as it should. I wish the battery lasted longer, I have to charge it once a day. Other than that I have no complaints."
hagagia,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Easy to set up and does everything that she needs.
Marcy ,Easy to set up and use
danerlu,"This is my first smartwatch, and I must say, I am thrilled.Tracking sleep cycles was something I wanted to do-- and my watch did not disappoint.Adding google assistant to this watch has become a life-saver when on the go.Still learning the interface, and love the customizable watch faces.Only downside is that in the first few days, charging the watch will be needed due to the watch learning your battery patterns.Definitely an amazing product."
C.R.M.,6k steps at work easy an this thing makes me feel like a slow lazy work day is hard. Battery life is ok. 3 days in an lowest I got by the end of the day is like 60%. Maybe if I was using apps heavy I'd have to charge halfway through the day but idk. Who spends all day on apps on a watch?? Maybe I'll update if this thing sucks in a month or two but for now it does its job. Prime day for the win.
mishqueen,"Watch mostly gets used to track my fitness on runs, but depending on the weather the same distance ran greatly varies day to day... Other than that I would recommend this watch, especially for the price."
June D.,Very nice
Ed Kimy,Easy to use.. Samsung delivered everything it offered for the watch. Downloaded the app to start the watch and everything is crystal clear on all the operations.. fast charging and I just charge at night and it lasts all day according to my activities... Thanks is in order
Cheri,Used with g watch wear app and wearable widgets app to get my CGM data on my watch. Works perfectly!
Cheri,Love this watch! It does everything! I am so very happy with this watch!!
V,
Tabitha,"It is everything I expected.  I waited until it went on sale, and I am very happy with this purchase.  It has good fitness features and the battery life is good for me.  Clarity is great with the telephone calls."
T. R.,This paired easily with my Android phone.  It is lightweight and easy to read.  My hands are a little big for some of the apps but a stylus works great.  I suggest watching some You Tube videos as tutorials for the watch.
Shirley Dein,"I purchased this watch for my wife  for Christmas, I received it on time in the original box very nice, my wife lives it definitely would recommend."
PrincessMeaniePants,"The watch is great, I love the compatibility with my phone. The battery will only last about a day, I have to charge it every day. The good news is that it doesn't take that long to charge, so I charge mine every morning while I'm eating breakfast and getting ready for the day and it's good to go until the next morning."
Caitlin,I think the watch is great and works wonderful with my Pixel 7 Pro. After wearing it for a couple days I noticed my arm looks burnt. It must be something with the strap. The watch itself left no marks just the strap. I sanitized it when I got it. Not sure what happened.Guess I'll have to try a new strap or return it.I really like the watch. Its very user friendly and one of the few watches with trip detection.But leaving a mark on my arm isn't ok. Hope it's just an isolated incident.
Riley,"The new OS on the watch is nice. It's easier to use and UI elements are larger and easier to read. The band that comes with it is pretty thick, but it's easy to change. The watch is slimmer and generally looks better than previous models. It has the usual pulse rate monitoring for working out and some ""gee whiz"" features like ECG and body comp. I'm disinclined to rely on them heavily but it will be interesting to see if the longitudinal data is of any value. Unfortunately, battery life is poor. I'm getting no more than 36 hours on a charge rather than the 3 days I was getting from my Active 2. If you buy this watch, plan to put it on a charger at some point most days."
C.R.M.,"Battery life is terrible, I had a fit bit before that I only charged once per week, and even with limited options turned on I have to charge this watch every 36 hours, or less.The sleep tracking is horribly inaccurate! I loaded photos, it is constantly thinking I'm taking naps even though I'm clearly awake. Just sitting still. And it won't let you edit those times at all. It's either delete or deal. Fit bit was super accurate. And was able to be edited if it did track wrong.Also it does NOT track walking if you are pushing a stroller, so you get no credit for walking, and it stops tracking if you sent move your arm obnoxiously.  I know some people say put it on your ankle, but that defeats the purpose of a watch.Needs some serious work."
mishqueen,Doesn't last long battery wise. Otherwise very accurate
KeKe,"make sure it has the functions you want. Battery life could be better, but it does charge quickly"
Retail Never!,I purchased this watch purposely because it had fall detection. I did fall and landed on the arm that the watch was on and fractured my elbow but the fall detection didn't pick up the fall and call my emergency contact.  Very disappointed. The battery life is not good either.  The EKG feature doesn't work with all phones.
Lori  J,"I do love the look of this watch. I had the Gearfit 2 before so I like the change in style. However, this one has to be charged every day which is highly undesirable and annoying. I'll definitely be upgrading from this one SOON."
Jamie Jo,So happy with my purchase. Works 100% so good and I love all the things about it
fortunate1,"Watched was a great product until it stopped working. Set it on the charger for about thirty minutes after it died. When I went to turn it back on the screen wouldn't come on, but I could tell it was on because it was vibrating for phone calls and messages. The backside looked like the battery leaked acid out.Being only 8 months old Samsung told me it was still under warranty and sent me to a repair shop about 40 minutes away, who told me that they cannot repair watches, which Samsung knows but sends people to anyways, and I'd have to send it to Samsung.The day Samsung received the watch they sent me a bill for $176 saying it was out of warranty. I called and they said it had liquid damage (if you google,many people have been told the same thing when it breaks) and was no longer powering on. The watch has never been in the shower or pool, only in rain which it is supposedly water resistant up to 200' of water. It also powered on before sending it to them.I argued with them and Mikayla in the repair department said they would have a second person look into it and call back in 48 hours. 4 days later I recieved an email saying the watch was being returned unfixed and I never received a call back so I called and was told it was set for exchange. Talked to someone in the case management department and they said the price was going to be refunded. I asked how long and they said once the paperwork it accepted, then asked me to confirm my contact so they could START the paperwork. They never contacted me to start the paperwork, so I'm sure they were hoping I wouldn't call back and are still trying to stall. They told me to call back if I hadn't heard anything by Thursday, so I will be calling then."
Tiffany,Although I have not learned all of the features of the Samsung watch I am really enjoying the sleep monitoring feature in addition to the step counter.
Veronika M,"Let me uninstall Bixby and use ECG without a Samsung account. I understand data is king but let me just use the hardware without the Samsung telemetrics please. It's a pain to have to root hardware just to get full functionality. It might be a good idea to get the blood pressure module approved before advertising it as well.Besides gating features behind an Samsung account, the hardware itself is well done. Fits my wrist well, band is comfy, and doesn't get hot at all. The heart beat, step, and blood O2 monitors are neat as well. Battery life isn't great (at 48% after about 8 hours of use) but I guess you can charge it before bed.I was looking forward to try the sleep analysis but it looks like snore detection is locked behind a Samsung account as well :("
Gorlack eater of worlds,Estoy muy decepcionada el reloj es muy lindo y todo pero la bateria parece de un reloj viejo no llega ni a medio dia sin darle prácticamente uso.
Joe Q.,excellent product
Amazon Customer,"Bought the watch so I could keep track of my heart rate and steps.  The best rate works pretty good,  I have it on continuous but sometimes when I look at it out gives me the rate from x minutes ago.  Steps matches pretty good.  Sleeping- the watch tells you your sleeping if you are relaxing on the couch, laying in bed watching TV.  My heart rate are wonky so that may be part of the reason it doesn't ready right.  My big issue is the watch seems to be burning my wrist.  I don't wear it in the shower and it doesn't get wet."
C.R.M.,"Very frustrated with this expensive watch, it started out tracking my GPS walks, and when I review my history, they are no longer there.  The history is there, but my GPS route is gone.  And when I walk, it does not track my GPS route and more.  I reset it, and it doesn't help.  I sent it in and they said everything was fine.  I got it back, it still does not track my GPS.  My son has the same watch, we set them both up at the same time. His continues and still tracks his GPS route.  Mine still does not.  That feature was one of the main reasons I got this watch.  And disappointed in the battery life, needs to be charged every night.  Would never get another Samsung Watch again"
mishqueen,This watch doesn't even hold a charge for a full day.  About 8 hours and that is it.  Disappointed.
Catherine Stephens,Easy set up and use. Clear sound quality on both ends of the call.
Gerry,"Compre el reloj, pero la bateia tenia muy bajo rendimineto, duraba muy poco la carga y lo regrese"
Gerry,I like it. It works way better than my fitbit. This watch has yet to track my sleep and the battery dies super fast.
Amazon Customer,It's a awesome watch but I do wish battery life was better.
Reika,Use the Samsung  health tracker all the time. Easy to use.
Reika,Comes in handy. Have had a couple of health issues and it helps keep me safe
Wanda,"Battery is horrible, could not even get through 24 hours without charging.  My Fitbit runs rings around it!  Disapointed.  All other features great."
Kindle Customer,Works as advertised no problems
Amazon Customer,Gift
Jennifer,Wife loves it
Ed Marmon,"Works great, have difficulty with the SPO2 feature, doesn't track consistently through night no matter how tight you have the band and seems to read low (recently bought a spo2 monitor only and it reads 10% higher through night than the samsung which is probably because it seems to have difficulty ready most all time not just of a night).  Have always had fitbit products in the past, wish the app was more user friendly like the fitbit app.  Also tends to have difficulty with the ecg readings, almost have to have your arm slightly damp to get any of these readings work (ecg, spo2, or body composition)."
Ed Marmon,"I use the watch with non-galaxy Android smart phone. The watch has good looking style. Overall, the functionalities are good. However, the most annoying bug is that whenever the phone went to airplane mode and turn off airplane mode, the watch won't reconnect. It will require user to reset (clear everything) the watch in order for it to reconnect to the phone. It might be a software bug but not sure if Samsung will cooperate with other phone company to fix this issue."
E. Thompson,"This is a very feature-packed watch. I'm not sure it's great for me, as, even with a large face, the features are so small that they are hard to read. Many offer the option of reading them on the phone, but then there is not much reason to have the watch!  The major disappointment is the very short battery life! It has to be charged every evening or it won't be charged enough through the night to monitor my sleep (which is important to me).  A lot of money for a fancy toy, I'm afraid!"
C.R.M.,"I'm in love with my Galaxy Watch 4. The battery life is decent but I can't go more than about 2 & a half days without needing to charge it but I charge it every night anyway. There aren't a whole lot of options in terms of cute & practical watch faces but that's okay. The heart rate monitor & ECG abilities are very handy. Seems to be pretty accurate. I also like that when I set it to ""walk"" it keeps track of my heart rate as I'm walking. You can track your stress level & it gives you ways to manage your stress. It has a TON of great things. Give it a try."
mishqueen,"This watch is great for texting, phone calls and my most important feature keeping track of my steps. The battery life didn't last as long as I would like it to but I can live with it. I have to charge it every night."
Adrienne,Fantastic in every way except the battery life.  My old galaxy watch would last almost 5 days per charge.  I'm lucky if I get 2 or three or if this one.  Even less if I have a busy watch face on.
Adrienne,"I was skeptical to buy this watch because it was refurbished, but I was pleasantly surprised. It arrived in excellent shape with directions. It has a long battery life and great call quality.  The features remind me when I have been sitting too long and actually tells me to get moving Well excuse me:) I am glad I decided to take a chance and buy this amazing watch."
Alicia Fox,Battery life  sucks maybe a day
warren,"I bought the wifi only version. I love this watch but there are some things it needs to improve. It's not very precise tracking runs (again this is the wifi only version, so I have no internet when I run), the body composition app just doesn't work, you need to install separate apps on your phone to get the full functionality of the watch, the battery lasts about a day so it's not so bad but not great either. I still love this watch and use it every single day"
Melanie F.,"Great, amazing watch and I haven't begun to learn all capabilities, just have to charge approximately every 36-48hrs, otherwise, it's amazing. It gets warm when charging but never overheats, once charged the watch and charger must disconnect to prevent overheating and overcharging-great attribute. Heck the band is so smooth and comfortable I don't know I'm wearing it. The speech to text is right on!!!"
T. Anton,My husband loves it
T. Anton,"The watch was OK. Setting it up for some things, like email, didn't seem to be worth the effort. They need some sort of very instinctive system for notifications. The real problem was the battery. I tried it with the screen on, but that was no good. Then I turned the screen off so you had to hit the power button. That seemed to push the battery to a day and a bit more. But basically it had to be charged every day. Then the battery life went over a cliff, down to 12 hours. I don't know what the deal was. The best thing was the fitness tracker. I got some information, but it was the same info you can get with an app on your phone. Now I was sending the data to the phone. There were two health apps, which is confusing. Trying to add something to a list was goofy. There's a system where you draw the letters, but it barely works, even when it is pretty obvious. But it didn't know an l from a 1, that sort of thing. The little keyboard was impossible. The voice typing was hit and miss. Doesn't seem fully baked. You buy these things, you get a month of frustration, and then you return them.  Anything you can do on your phone, and I have a Galaxy s21, you should do on your phone."
Brittany Davis,Everything about this watch is great for except the battery life.  Has to be charged daily.
Tony,Works. Got it in good time.
GNA,I LOVE THIS WATCH. IS MY FIRST NON Apple Watch
GNA,Not happy with battery life. Have to charge every day. Still learning all features.
Tom,"Love this watch, especially the GPS fall detection. Am still figuring out pairing to Spotify. I think it requires bluetooth earbuds to do it. Anyway, other features are great!"
Ana Iris Espinal,The white color bands suck. I clean it a lot and it still gets dirty and yellowish and even causes some skin irritation. But it was 50 dollars cheaper than the other colors so I'll just buy some aftermarket bands and a protector. The watch itself is like a 2nd phone. It uses almost the same gestures and apps. It connected easily to my Samsung TV and phone and only gets down to about 60% battery after a full day of use.
C.R.M.,It is awesome
mishqueen,Love this watch!
Leonbert Quintero,I love all the features however the battery life is terrible! Has to be charged 2x a day or more if really active. Think I'm going back to the Fitbit.
Christy Parrish,"This was my second attempt at a smart watch as the first one didn't fit to my wants too well but this one fits me to a t! The only problem I have is the battery life and the sleep tracking feels off sometimes. The battery life isn't the best really as you basically have to charge it everyday but that's not the biggest problem really. But in general, quite happy with my purchase!"
Christy Parrish,"Lots of amazing health apps! Battery lasts about 2 days. If new to smart watches you might have a tough learning curve, but so worth it!"
Cherylgirl,Battery life is great. Display excelleny.
Sherrie Knodel,I like the added apps. Waiting to upgrade to a galaxy phone to do the ECG... Only negtive I have is that the watch3 feels WAY heavier than the watch4-which could be a positive to some... It just doesnt feel a luxurious as the watch3. I didnt get the classic(with the bezel) but it has a bezel on the screen so i dont miss it at all. Still give it 5 stars (plus I got mine on prime day-so only $150! ❤
Judy Lehr,"I got this, one for my husband and one for me. Both used in like new condition. The price was awesome and got extra discount on Prime Day.They both look like new, have the Amazon Seal and come with original chargers and box.I think it's still missing more apps like the Apple Watch, but it's a great smart watch. If you're a Samsung user, this is a great add."
Rafael D.,"I really like this watch. Never had a wearable before but it's quickly becoming one of my favorite pieces of tech. I love that I can answer calls and texts very quickly. My calls are clear and fast. I love that it gives me more accurate activity info than my phone. It's also so nice that it looks and feels like a regular watch, and is super customizable. I'm in love!"
Stormy,"I like how lightweight it is, easier to use however doesn't keep charge for long, very frustrating. The app seems a tad confusing to use"
Coach Davis,It does a lot of what is advertised well. Needs a lot more Samsung made watch faces. Disappointed that you can't use the ECG app outside the US
Amazon Customer,"I really like the design. So far it's been easy to use. I was surprised at how short the battery life was compared to my old Blaze, but this has so many more functions. I charge it  while I'm doing dishes or watching TV, so it's always charged at night to monitor my sleep."
donna bridgmon,The battery lifespan is not good and now it is flickering.
C.R.M.,It literally tracks everything including how much you snore a night. When un sleep mode you want get woke up by the phone or anything.
mishqueen,I like the battery life and the way it works with my phone.
Amazon Customer,"What a great watch, but battery life truly is terrible.  It doesn't even last the day and that's with not having always on watch face and not checking it often. Really a shame"
Tom Janicki,                    The media could not be loaded.                 I like being able to choose the watch face.  Too soon to say what I dislike.  Waiting for granddaughter to show me more to do with it.
Amazon Customer,I love everything about my watch. I think I just need to put some apps to sleep to help with the battery life.
Anthony Burkett,I have only had it for a week and so far I love the watch. It's a tremendous upgrade from my active 2...
JKaufmann,"First of all, let me just say I'm comparing this watch to an Apple Watch.  Not really much comparison, Apple has it hands down.  I recently switched to a Samsung Phone.  I like the phone, but strongly dislike the watch.  The range to the phone has to be so close, why even bother . . . This morning I was on the elliptical machine for a little over a mile (30 minutes) and I just noticed a little while ago my watch said 531 steps.  How can that be??? My apple watch gave me credit for a workout and it counted towards my steps.  This watch isn't as user friendly as the Apple watch either.  Oh, and I didn't rate the sleep tracking because I've never used it, so can't say if it's good or bad for that.  For those who are looking for something comparable to the Apple Watch, this watch isn't for you.  For those who have never had an Apple watch, maybe this will work for you, not sure."
Honest User,I like the watch well enough but I have it so limited on what it can do to save battery life and it still drains fast. My fitbit did more and the battery didn't drain need to be charged so often. Very disappointed in that.
Amazon Customer,"It is great and does all that us needed. But only lasts a day. Then the battery is dead. So when using for. Whole day, it doesn't  get the chance to track my sleep. Unless you charge it right before bed"
Jessica W.,"I'm very happy with my Galaxy watch. Battery life is good, it's easy to talk into for calls, and was super simple to set up. I wpild definitely recommend!"
Jessica W.,This watch provides fall protection  which is the main feature I wan ted.
Rocci,Watch is working well after 3 weeks. Charge can last two days. More apps needed to be 5 stars.
Samantha Haba ,"Figured by now the censor for the heart rate could have been upgraded enough to not hate my tattoos.  Alas, that feature is generally useless."
C.R.M.,"Battery does not last even 8h on standby (only turning on the screen when I raise my arm to check the time). And this is how much it lasted the first time I used it (shortly after I bought it and after fully charging it).Nevertheless, the watch looks nice, waistband fits well and is comfortable."
mishqueen,"Honestly this is a great watch. It does everything I need it to and I primarily use it to monitor my heart rate, sleep tracking, and texting and calling. The only issue I have is with the battery life and that I have to use a wireless charger with it instead of being able to plug it in like I have with my Apple watch."
Yvette Butler,"I was quite excited to upgrade to a fancier version of my Galaxy Fit. And at first everything seemed great. I did buy more comfortable bands from Etsy, but even that didn't help much. And I thought the battery life would be okay, but compared to the Fit, it was awful. And if it's going to track sleep, why would I want to charge it every night? I will say that it seemed to charge very fast.It didn't seem to track my walking very well, at least automatically. It would start very late. I didn't care because I use an app on my phone for that.I didn't learn much about the functionality, since I did return it. I decided to return it the day I had it charged it to 100%, then it did an update, and when I went to check the weather the phone was off. I tried to turn it on and discovered it was dead. Since it uses a proprietary charger and I was at work, I had to just wear a dead watch all day.I could probably deal with the comfort by finding the right band, but the battery life is too terrible for something this expensive."
Shakeya,My son bought this with his first paycheck and totally loves it. Best purchase he has made yet and at a great price.
Amazon Customer,"It's been disappointing from day one of getting this watch. As a galaxy phone user, I decided to upgrade from a 7 year old watch to this, thinking it can only be better. I was so wrong... Bugs that I've noticed so far:1. Always on display is dim, so when running outside in the sun you can't see anything. There's no way to make it brighter, you have to touch the watch/raise wrist to turn it back on, rendering AOD worthless2. GPS is slow and inaccurate. Example: running 100m sprints, according to the watch, my top speed was 10mph - yes, 10!!! This is my max out of 8 x 100m sprints. I run 10k at 10mph pace.3. There is no heart rate zone training in the app. Old watch has it4. Can't adjust your heart rate zones. My maximum heart rate is much higher than the watch has by default which makes all of my zones wrong. My old watch can be adjusted5. My old watch has a mode where you race vs your  previous run. Not GW46. It loses my heart rate all the time when using 'Other workout'One more thing, Samsung health app shows a graph of your workout with time on the X axis. However, you can't tell what exact minute and second the point on the graph refers to. It'd be great to be able to see that (needless to say, my 7 year old watch has that functionality).I was thinking about returning the watch from the beginning but was trying to find solutions to those issues. Now my 30 days are over and it seems these are the worst 150 bucks I've ever spent. Samsung just seem to be a decade behind true sports watch companies. I'll try to get rid of this and get a Pilar/Fitbit/etc., I know those work as they are supposed to. I do NOT recommend this watch"
Andi,"This is my third Galazy watch and it's my favorite!  I've got a Galaxy Watch 3 Classic and Galaxy Active.  To me it's faster and easier to use than the Watch 3.  I love being able to customize the watch face with a picture of my dog!  I'm not crazy about the battery life, I like to have the watch always on, but I've got two other watches to wear when this needs charging.  I can usually get 8 - 12 hours out of a charge and would get more if I didn't have it in the ""always on"" mode, but it's the look that I like.  Not sorry I bought this, it's a beautiful watch."
Andi,"Once again Samsung provides a terrible experience. While there's the usual things like Samsung apps you can't disable or get rid of, it has an absolutely terrible user experience. Several times, after rebooting my phone (Pixel 7) the watch failed to reconnect and would have to be reset as if I was connecting to a new phone (that it has to reset to connect to a new phone instead of checking if you're signed into a Samsung account on a new device and just connecting is terrible on its own). Then when I would go to restore my old settings from the cloud backup, it would say the restore was successful but nothing would change on the watch. So what's the point of this function if it doesn't actually restore anything? Poor experience and once again proves that Samsung isn't worth the effort."
Abrilla Ruiz,Realmente el producto está bueno y no tiene nada que envidiarle a la quinta generación si aún puedes conseguirlo a un precio módico. Yo compre el 4 días antes de que presentaran el 5 y no me arrepiento.
George,"the battery requires charging at least daily, sometimes twice daily. I have followed the recommendations for preserving battery life with little effect.  What is the point of having the features on the watch if you have to turn them off to get any battery life?"
Steve,It's ok
Steve Scott Chastain,Good product
Brunoski,"Tracks my steps, sleep, heart rate, and the weather even. Even tells me when I am stressed and need to breath. Water proof. Battery life has been great. Easy to connect to phone and or ear buds. Can play your music, talk, and text on it as well. I love it. Sleek and durable band."
