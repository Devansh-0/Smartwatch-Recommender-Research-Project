Karthiga K,"Watch is very smooth, looks premium.Don't worry about too many features not being available. Whatever is loading into the watch works absolutely perfect. Reading is accurate.Go with it, if you are an OnePlus user without any second thought."
Vandana yadav,NHealth Application they provide for this watch is too bad.It's always show's errors.When changing faces it shows error
Workhard,no warranty either
Naresh,App not open properly or not register new account then how to check watch
ADITYA SHRIVASTAV,Worked ok for couple of months. Later started frequently disconnecting requiring to pair. Gets discharged fast and does not change beyond 75%. Other features are ok; nothing great
Gurme N.,Nice watch with strongly working basic features and good connectivity.Amazon CC doesn't know anything about this watch so don't expect any support from there side call one plus for any kind of issue.
Amazon Customer,Only the reason i returned it is that you have to download n health app which is so annoying it never closes somehow also face gallery was worst part of this watch for me.
Deepesh Sharma,"There's no option to return but only replace. So please pay attention.1. Build quality is decent. Looks are quite premium.2. Features wise this watch lacks the basic functionality like inbuilt GPS, ability to answer calls.3. Poor app support. Just have a look at the N app rating on play Store. No other third party app support.4. Sleep tracking doesn't work!! Tried for multiple days yet no tracking.There are better options to consider at this range.I'm disappointed at OnePlus, I trusted the brand name yet it feels like a waste of money."
Sonia Deval,Seems great after 1 day of use. Good screen. Sunlight visibility good. Call and message notifications fine. Though being able to answer calls would have been great. SpO2 and heart rate monitor works great.
Van.S,From last one month I am wearing this and slowly slowly it burnt the watch face area of my skin as you can see in image.Iâ€™ll not suggest to any1 buy this..Can I return it now..very bad experience :(
