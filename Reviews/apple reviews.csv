K. A.,"I was extremely skeptical of the Apple Watch when it first hit the market. To be frank, I thought they were pretentious and unnecessary. Over time, I saw how my friends and coworkers enjoyed theirs, so I decided to jump on the bandwagon and I am so glad I did. I will be the first to admit I was wrong.Like a fair amount of the American population, I have ADD. Also like a fair amount of the American population, I sit behind a computer from 8-5. I would hyper focus and go hours working on a project without standing or taking a break. With my apple watch, it quietly and quickly vibrates every hour to remind me to stand up, and I will walk a lap. Then come back to my work. I like the challenge of meeting my goals (which are adjustable) and I can ‚Äúcompete‚Äù with my friends in different states for bragging rights regarding meeting goals.I also do not ‚Äúdoomsday scroll‚Äù on my iPhone at nights as much, because I can leave my phone in another room knowing I won‚Äôt miss a text or a call due to the texts/calls coming through on my watch.Overall, as ridiculous as typing it out is, this watch has been a good tool for my mental and physical health. I‚Äôve lost weight (and kept it off). I will cave and admit that this watch is great."
Sparky,"I finally bought an Apple watch because I've been wanting to improve my mental health with more physical activities. At first I was annoyed by all the notifications I received on the watch; it's essentially a mirror of your smartphone. After I turned most of them off except phone calls/texts it was much better to use.While the battery life is not as long as other competition out there, there are some features that I think make the watch worth it:1. Fitness+- LOVE THIS APP! I'm currently trailing it free for 3 months, and it's a game changer. I love how there is new content weekly for different exercises like kickboxing, pilates, HIIT, yoga, dance, etc. I have a smart tv and stream the videos on there. I get to see my heart rate and calories burned LIVE, so it motivates me to work harder. You can also filter the exercises by duration, music genre, fitness instructor, and more! I will definitely be keeping the subscription after my trial is over; it''s definitely worth it.2. Daily/weekly challenges with myself and friends- I enjoy the rings concept and connecting with my friends who also have an Apple watch. I get notifications of when they complete a workout, which encourages me to exercise myself.3. Find My- I use this app constantly to find my phone in another room.4. Direct streaming to my iPhone- it is nice to see my stats on my phoneOverall, if you're considering getting an Apple Watch, do it. I selected this one because I don't need the data option, and this is a budget friendly enough device for so much value."
K. A.,"I've had several Apple watches and so far have been happy with them.  My one complaint is that I HAVE NO WAY TO CHARGE THIS THING, and thank goodness I have my charger from the previous watch.  While the charger it comes with looks just like the others, the end of it IS NOT USB.  It is much smaller and I have absolutely NOTHING in my possession that I can plug it into.  I thought it would plug into my phone, perhaps, but it doesn't fit.  I have an Apple computer but there are no ports that match the watch charger, either.  So, I'm SOL on using the charger it came with until I figure out what to do.  I realize all I need is to perhaps buy something but I'm not willing to go there since I can use my other charger which works fine.  As for the watch itself, I really do like it.  I appreciate the extra storage space and it definitely works faster.  I can store more music in it and the large variety of watch faces is a plus for me.  There are more than enough apps on this and I turned off the ones I know I'll never use - some are ridiculous - such as, it senses when you are washing your hands and starts a 20 second timer.  That's too much ""big brother"" type stuff for me - I don't need help.  I would recommend that if you are replacing this with an older Apple Watch that you choose the manual setup and don't allow it to automatically set based on your old watch.  This is how I was able to catch what I would consider too much nosiness and turn it off.  I mainly use the watch for running, listening to music, catching phone calls and emails, etc...just daily stuff.  So I don't need anything over the top.  However, for the average person, this is a great watch with more than enough functions.  All of the bands for my previous watch fit it as well.  Just know that if you purchase this, you won't be disappointed with the watch itself, but beware that you won't be able to charge in a USB.  I don't know what Apple was thinking on that one.  Finally, there are NO charging instructions or explanations."
Crystal Jimenez,"Love the Apple watch and it has all the features I am looking for.  The weight and look is perfect for me.  The only dislike is that I have to recharge in the middle of the day or early evening in order to track my sleep patterns.  With a longer battery life, I would truly be able to track my steps throughout each and every day as well as moniter my sleep."
C Miles,I bought this watch for my girlfriend who is a nurse. She has told me it has come very valuable to her at work to setting timers to take care of patients! It‚Äôs worth every penny!
Train4u2,"I absolutely hate apple products but my mum loves apple. Loves her iphone and always wanted an apple watch. So finally I broke down and bought her this one for a Christmas present last 2022 and she absolutely loves it. Now, seeing as how I do not have not use it I can not really give an indepth review on the product, 4 months later, it is part of her daily kit and routine. So, (shudders) 5...stars. üòñ"
Sean,"Watch works fine, like all smart watches. Wish battery lasted longer.  Also wished it had a blood pressure monitor.  Have another smart watch, which was a third of the cost of the Apple Watch and it included a blood pressure monitor.  No issues with this watch so far."
Moxie,"The face is larger, battery charges faster and all bands from original 38mm fit perfectly. A great affordable upgrade."
Mark P.,I had an Apple Watch Series 3 for 4 years up until I decided to upgrade to this! And I love it! I love the size of the 40 mm because it‚Äôs comfortable on my hand and it works very well and charges super fast!
sewjudy,Idk why it took this long to finally get one of these . So easy to set up. Looks good with the different band we got here on Amazon the apple bands are just way too much money for what they are. The battery life for my wife is OK it lasts more than a day but we charge it every day around the same time to make sure it doesn‚Äôt run out.
Bella,"I‚Äôve had Apple Watches from the very beginning. Sadly, my earlier model needed replacing due to a cracked screen. So, I ordered this one late last year and I‚Äôm very happy that I did! It‚Äôs sleek, accurate and beautiful."
Bella,Love my watch. There are less missed messages and calls since the watch vibrates. I can choose if I want to interrupt what I am doing. Easy set up. Pairing with iPhone is user friendly. A lot of extras for health. Definitely a good choice for me.
Sue Z.,"I‚Äôve had this watch for a couple of months and cannot say enough good things! It makes it easy to track your workouts and heart rate. Very easy to set up and use, not to mention the battery lasts me 2 days! Don‚Äôt know how I lived without it! Also great for easily seeing my notifications when I‚Äôm working from home! Love being able to see work things while moving around my house"
K. A.,"I was skeptical at first because it was from the Amazon Warehouse, however mine was brand new! Box was unopened as was the watch band! It was easy to sync up and I got it wayyyyy cheaper than going to target or the Apple Store"
Sparky,Bought one for my Dad and I.  Very pleased with them.
Lorraine,Even though it was a refurbished item it‚Äôs working like I just bought it from the Apple Store.
Amazon Customer,"It's incredible, the product seems as good as one new and the battery health was a 100%"
Kaitlin,I purchased the midnight aluminum in 40 mm and really love it! It‚Äôs my first Apple Watch and I can‚Äôt believe I waited so long. Shipping was super fast.
Lydia M Zapata,Thank you
Tammy G,"I've worn this watch now for a few months and really like it.  It's great to see who is calling without taking my phone out of my pocket every time my phone rings. I do wish it had face dial with larger Day/Date in the corner. My 64  year old eyes cant see the smaller Date or Temp in the corners. Being able to hang up on annoying spam calls from my watch, leaving my phone in my pocket is the best feature."
oscar,The watch is great for most users because it has most of the basic features you would need in a smart watch. This is especially a great buy for people on a budget. I only wished that the battery life lasted a bit longer. I have the gps only watch so I don‚Äôt know how it fares on a cellular network but it‚Äôs nice that you can walk a bit of distance from your watch and still have access to the internet. I mostly use the watch to get notifications from my phone without having to take out my phone (at work).
Jorge Barraza Z,"I had the Fitbit Versa 2 prior to purchasing the Apple Watch SE.  I love a number of the features that I did not have before.  The integration with my iPhone and the ability to take and receive calls is great.  It senses a fall which since I am well into my senior years means a lot.  While there are an abundance of health and fitness apps for the SE I‚Äôd have to say that the Fitbit App beats anything I have found so far for the SE.  The Fitbit had a battery life that lasted about a week - the SE barely  makes it through one day if you use very many of the SE‚Äôs capabilities - a real problem if you use the sleep monitoring function.  Overall the SE is a great, solid feeling watch, but is very lacking is a couple of critical areas."
Shopgirl18,Welcome to the 21st century.  Amazing. Don‚Äôt know how I lived without it
Nataliya Abramyuk,I debated for a few years whether or not to get one of these watches. I didn‚Äôt want it to be a bigger distraction or keep me on my phone more. But it‚Äôs actually done the opposite! I check my messages real quick and don‚Äôt have to pull my phone out of my purse! Battery life is ok. I have to charge mine every night. Plus there are so many bands and cases you can get for it to Make it your own style!
Richard,The battery could last longer and I don‚Äôt think I understand the feature
K. A.,Had this for about a week now. Really happy with purchase. Came in wonderfully packaged. Brand new from box. So far it‚Äôs working as it should. Connected to my phone easily. Battery is the same as my old watch (s5). Will last all day and through the night but needs to be placed on charger to last the next morning which is fine because I take mine off every night and place it on it‚Äôs charger til 100% then turn it off until next day. Came with small size band which were perfect. Beautiful color. Came with charging  cord. NOTE: the charging cable is a C charger. have to have a C port charging block. Over all I love it so much. Will update when I‚Äôve had it over two months!Buy this watch!
Sparky,I wish battery life was better. I have turned off  a lot of notifications on this watch. But I like the idea of ‚Äúfall detection‚Äù and answering phone calls and texts from my watch
Alyssa,"UPGRADES from Watch SE (2020):-S8 chip: Up to 20% faster than previous Watch SE in theory (previous version was using S5 chip)-Crash detection:  Will detect if you are in a crash (same tech in iPhone14 and Watch Series 8)-Price: Starts at $249, currently older Watch SE (2020) is still priced at $269Other changes:  Back of watch is no longer ceramic, now just plastic and aluminumSo, not huge changes from the previous SE really.  This watch comes with OS 9, but the older SE (2020) is also able to upgrade its software to Watch OS 9.  So far in testing, the battery life also seems to be about the same as the older SE.  So OVERALL, it does not seem to me to be worth upgrading from the old SE to this SE2.  I haven‚Äôt been able to notice much of a difference, and I actually prefer the ceramic back of the old SE (2020).  If you feel the need to upgrade from SE (2020), you might want to look at the other new Watch 8 models that have more features.----CHOOSING BETWEEN WATCH SE2 AND WATCH 8?:Compared to Watch Series 8, this SE2 is missing these features:-No ECG, No blood oxygen, No temp sensor:  These sensors on Watch 8 can provide more health data.-No fast charging:  Fast Charging is supported on Watch 7 series and Watch 8 series (including Watch Ultra).-No IP6X dust resistance:  Watch 8 has an IP6X rating, which means that it is safe from dust/debris.-No Always-On-Display:  Watch 8 has Always-On-Display.-Size:  The Watch 8 face is bigger (41mm and 45mm, vs 40mm and 44mm), but with smaller bezels; resulting in 20% more screen area on Watch 8 compared to SE2.-No U1 Ultra-Wideband: U1 chip allows for more precise location of devices, for use in multiple applications.-Battery:  Watch 8 has 308mAh battery, SE2 is listed at 296mAh (both rated 18 hours though).Currently Watch 8 is about $150 more than SE2, so it is up to you to decide if you want to spend more to get access to these additional features.  For me, the biggest noticeable differences between the two are the screen size, Always-On-Display, and charging speeds.  The Always-On-Display makes a difference of a second or two whenever you get a notification, not a huge deal but noticeable.  I also like the faster charging of Watch 8 because I usually sleep with my Watch on to get sleep tracking data, so I mainly charge during the day, and being able to do that faster means more time actually wearing the watch.Ultimately, you‚Äôll have to decide what is important to you, and if you need an even more rugged/durable Watch for lots of rough outdoor use, there is always the Watch 8 Ultra.  Ultra is even bigger, brighter, and more durable, with a bigger battery and feature designed to cater to outdoor activities."
Dan,Me encanto
JerandJan,Solid for sleep apps and heart monitor.
Sabrina Schwendeman,Watch stop working  and couldn't  be charged. We did the recommended procedure and still nothing happens
Linda Benedict,Very fashionable
SkylarElizabeth‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,"The Apple Watch is great and the features are very good.  However the battery life is not very good.  I have to recharge it every night.  I thought the battery would last at least a couple of days, but I have to charge it every night so I am unable to have it record my sleep patterns."
SkylarElizabeth‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,"Me encanto esta compra, excelente precio y calidad"
Wendy Wilson,"I got this after a serious illness to help me track my activity as o work to regain my strength and muscle tone.  Being old school it was hard to wear it in the pool but I got there!  The find your phone feature has proven useful as well.  I‚Äôve purchased several wristbands for fun, I like the flexibility with this feature.  I‚Äôm very pleased with this watch!!"
C,Happy
Cuauhtemoc Encarnacion,"Yes I do own an iphone but not a Apple maniac, had a electronic knockoff watch for the past few years and was given this for Xmas, very happy with it, linked to my phone so can dictate text messages when I have my hands full or my phone is somewhere in the houseDidnt get the Cellular version as the phone companies figure its another phone so charge you for another line *^#*@(* but for my needs its perfect, not really sure how many people need the cellular version, as long as you have wifi you dont really need it"
Cuauhtemoc Encarnacion,Bought this SE watch for my non-technical wife. It‚Äôs easy to use and my wife loves it.
David,
K. A.,"Wife loves it, seems to work great but it has to be charged every nite"
Sparky,"The battery in my old watch I have had 5 or more years and that battery is going strong on that and it only cost $55  and this apple watch was almost $300 and the batter needs charged every 12 hours or 24 or it dead..... being it cost $300 almost, the battery should last 10 years or more before a charge"
RICARDO,THEY DON'T TELL YOU WHAT TO CHARGE IT INTO!  ITS A VERY SMALL PORT TYPE IT ONLY FITS A PORT ON MY COMPUTER TO CHARGE THE DAMN WATCH.  NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO CHARGE THE WATCH! Something was either missing or just bad directions which doesnt seem like Apple.  I should have bought this watch from Apple not Amazon.  Big waste of my time. Buyer beware of the instructions.  The watch doesnt come powered up.  The instructions tell you it comes on right away. It doesn't!  Not happy.
shiqu,"This watch is amazing! It can do so much, With some really cool features such as the mickey or minnie watch face and when you tap them it says the time in there voice! So cute! The only thing pretty much is that its not a usb charger. It come with the charging wire, but you need a specific head for it! Thankfully, Awhile ago i bought an ipad that came with a charging head perfect for the watch charger. If you have a oculus, im pretty sure you could use that head too because my sister has one and the head for it works! All in all, i'd 100% recommend, Just make sure you also purchase the right head with it!"
Amazon Customer,Excelente producto
Pamela Rosales Espinoza,Used on a daily basis and enjoying all features
Pamela Rosales Espinoza,I had to buy a different band but the actual watch works well.
Amazon Customer,"I am completely heartbroken,DO NOT BUY IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN iPhone 8 or higher with ios 16 or higher!!ALSO DOES NOT COME WITH TYPE C WALL CHARGER REQUIRES IT TO BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY.I have wanted an Apple watch for a while now but i am disabled and very low income.after looking things up and going back and forth with my decision I finally landed on making the purchase because I felt informed enough and I still had deeply wanted one.I ordered it and got it a few days later, started setting it up and, bam first issue, no wall charger...found one and ordered it with 2 options, either order it overnight for an additional charge or wait a week for it to get here.I ordered it and it arrived, watch charged fine,then BAM second issue, it REQUIRES pairing with an iphone""luckily"", I thought, I had one from a purchase from a birthday gift a couple years agoI got the phone charged and turned on but the watch pairing said the ios was not updated on the phone. so I initiated the update and install,few minutes later the phone was updated, tried the pairing again and BAM another issue,the ios for iPhone 7 apparently only goes up to ios 15.5.7 or something like that and i am now stuck trying to figure out if I should keep the watch and save up for a refurb iphone 8 or higher or send the watch back for a refund.Heartbreaking :("
Rose Huddleston,Love this watch. Battery life could be better but its alright. One thing to beware of is the amount of scratches this thing gets and the photo is only within 50 hours of using it. I will be buying screen protectors because there are many more tiny scratches that my camera wont pick up
D. J. Finch,Battery lasts a long time! Great quality and it looks great!!
SPC,Nice watch
,
Shawn R,my wife love it
Sparky,Bought this for my kid and she absolutely loves it.  Great value for the price and would absolutely purchase again.
zhourongkai,Easy to charge and wonderful connectivity.
Tim M.,The battery doesn‚Äôt last as long as I had hoped
Kathy Janisch,"My first Apple Watch SE I was so excited when it arrived!  My happiness quickly faded when it wouldn't sink to my ios 6plus cell phone even though I updated it then I needed to charge my Apple Watch!  Why in the world wouldn't Apple let you know you need to buy a USB-C power adapter or you need a Charging Station.  It's like ""oh I didn't tell you"" the battery doesn't come with your car!  OMG!"
Linda Mansur,this watch is perfect‚Ä¶.i had previously purchased an apple 4 cellular watch brand new for about $500 bucks ‚Ä¶watch os7 trashed my battery life‚Ä¶i was charging that watch twice daily‚Ä¶.(i feel apple knew what the problem was but didn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶i got absolutely no help from them at all)‚Ä¶so i decided to get a new watch but as cheap as i could because i will NEVER spend big bucks on apple products again‚Ä¶enter se 2 gen watch and it is just what my other watch used to be‚Ä¶.i can even wear this for over two days and still have about 25 to 30 percent battery‚Ä¶true this does not have the ekg thing my 4 did but who cares‚Ä¶if that is important to you go with it‚Ä¶not for me..i wanted battery life‚Ä¶.i will now keep apple care for as long as i have this watch but i loved the fact that this was so inexpensive (235.00) compared to what i paid for the other one‚Ä¶
Sparky,Much better for smaller wrists.
real person,"I'm a woman with a small frame (5'5"" but a 5.5"" wrist, so.... tiny) and I wore the Apple Watch 8 41mm for a bit but it was just too large even at that size. I swapped it out for the SE and the 1mm reduction in screensize is not a negative at all, and the size difference is a big positive on my wrist. This one is actually comfortable to wear.For $250, this is a good watch. Battery life is the same as the Watch 8. Charging speed is similar. If you don't think you'll want features like the always-on screen and the temperature tracking (I didn't like or use either of those features), save your money and get the SE instead."
Diana H.,Buen estado
Jordan,"I felt this was the best value for my money.  I was already familiar with my earlier apple watch so the mobile app was good and easy to use just like with my series 2.  If you are considering this watch look at the difference between the SE and 8 or 8 plus.  Further, if battery life is an issue the 8 plus offers  by far the longest battery life. They have the always on face and a couple of features which the SE does not. The always on face and other features were really not important to me.  However, go to the Apple Website and look at the feature comparisons.  They may very well be worth you spending a little more money for the upgrade.  You can't go wrong with an Apple watch just make sure you get the watch you want with the features that are important to you."
Mildred,As ordered
Douglas,Got his for the wife for Christmas she loves it
Shawn R,"This was for my wife, she likes it! The SE is not as many features as the regular Apple watches but fits what she needs."
Sparky,The charger provided did not work. Apple did not supply a replacement but I could purchased a new one. This is poor customer service on a new item.
Rodney Oberle,I used this IWatch to replace my first one and it works great.  The screen is a little bigger which is nice.  I'm sure this one will last several years like the first one did.
Amazon Customer,"I've always wanted to purchase an apple watch but was hesitant because I have small wrist and most face watches don't sit right.  I decided to purchase the 30"" face and it fits perfect.  This watch app was easy to set up as  I didn't need by kids or grandkids to help...lol.  I'm enjoying the fitness portion of the app.  I've made a great choice on this product.  In addition, AMAZON offered 6-mo financing which was a big plus of the purchase."
Rick P.,"If you are having trouble pairing this to your iPhone please read the following review. First you must have an iPhone 8 or newer model. Second, and most importantly, you must be running iOS 16 or greater. I got this watch a few days ago and I could not wait to pair it with my iPhone 13.It would pair then unpair and over and over again. I tried to manually pair it, I reset my phone, the watch, my network settings (all of these tips were found online) but none of them mentioned needing the latest iOS. My phone updates automatically so I assumed I was on the latest iOS. I was not.It took me about 45 minutes for the phone and watch to update and finally pair.This watch is good but not great. The battery life is just not there yet. If you want to wear this watch for the fitness aspect of it and track your sleep data as well as have it as a shortcut to read messages and see notifications throughout the day it doesn‚Äôt give you much time during the day or night to charge it. I did all the battery saving tips and it was still only good for about a day and a half. Kinda like my phone. And it gets worse if you want full functionality.I also wanted to use this with my Arccos golf tracking system but the battery really goes quick using gps for an entire round of golf and it does not give you anything more than a very plain numeric only display with basic yardages. It was very comfortable to wear and it does have very cool customizable watch faces but the poor battery life was a deal breaker. Sorry but it‚Äôs heading back."
Jo,                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†this is such a pretty watch ü•∫i was so worried i‚Äôd get it scratched but nopeit came in the original packaging the only thing is that it was opened for inspection (there‚Äôs a sticker and tape around the watch box to check that it‚Äôs the actual watch lol) but i didn‚Äôt care and overall it‚Äôs so good üò≠i‚Äôd def recommend it <3
Scot Schroeder,"Wasn‚Äôt sure if I would like an Apple Watch, so I wanted to try the SE Second generation. This watch does everything I wanted it to. I use it to track all of my steps and all of my different workouts. I also love that I can get and send texts from my watch. The only thing I can‚Äôt do is send or receive texts if my phone is not nearby. I would def purchase this watch again."
Tweety bird,Love it
BirdHunter,"I am so happy I bought my Apple Watch. Overall I love my watch for keeping track of exercise and taking incoming calls and texts. I feel like it helps me stay off my phone but aware if someone messages me. I know someone with an older version and I can definitely tell the difference in speed while doing normal typing/ scrolling etc. I am glad I got this one due to the not lagging speed compared to other. I can get two days battery life out of my Apple Watch. The charge is fast, but extended battery life is always a plus for future improvements."
evy ,"This is my first time buying smart-watch, and was beyond my expectation.Goes well with my iPhone, applepay and now it is totally part of my life.Also it gave me an opportunity to re-think about my daily activity, sleep quality, etc..Definetely recommend."
evy ,Good tool to talk and text.  Also like the activity tracking features!
Joan Dutko,"Like all apple products, this watch is excellent. It‚Äôs accurate and intuitive and very easy to use. It definitely is a quality product. I‚Äôve had 3 fitbits and this is truly an upgrade."
rezanna willoughby,"I love all products from Apple. No complains. Well, I hope that the price can be lower..."
Shawn R,This is my second Apple Watch- the other fell apart after 6 years- but so far so good with this one.  It has functions the old watch didn't have (I really like the bpm on the face of the watch). My only criticism is it didn't come with a charging plug to the wall outlet. I'm having to unplug my iPad outlet to charge the watch. Ugh.
Sparky,It‚Äôs a good watch but honestly I don‚Äôt wear it to much
Lydia Johnson,"Muy buen reloj, tiene todo lo que necesitas y mas por un costo accesible"
Hiroki,The watch came in brand new in its original container. It works fabulously! It has so many new features that my old watch did not have. No issues with the watch at all.
Amazon Customer,"I really like it, but lost of scratches accumulate on both the watch, the case, and the screen. I also noticed that my fingernails imprint a crescent on the band."
mike s,You know
Chiqian Zhang,I‚Äôm happy with my watch
luna,Mostly a fun toy for grown ups. Battery sucks; you'll need to charge it every day. My wife uses it to compete on the fitness app with her friends.
Mackenzie,"Me gusto mucho √©l reloj creo que es muy pr√°ctico y bello, lo √∫nico malo ser√≠a que la Banda era muy grande talla M/L y yo soy S en la descripci√≥n dec√≠a Banda S"
Fernanda,"Im not up to date on technology, but the watch was easy to set up. The battery life is great. Still exploring its capabilities on the watch. All in all i loving it!"
Fernanda,"Surprise Christmas gift for my son, which he enjoys!"
Kristalyn Phillips,Cool watch. Battery only last a day.
Kainoa S.,"There is nothing I dislike. It‚Äôs perfect for me.  Thank God.  A blessing in disguise. In 2019, I started on A-Fib, after that, I purchased mine.  It let me know on time that I was on A-Fib twice, one in 2020, another in 2021. Got med attention on time, by making one aware, and rush to the hospital.  EVERYONE SHOULD GET ONE. Thanks A/W."
Shawn R,"I have the 7 and got two of these for my daughter. I was A littler nervous and read all the reviews carefully. Other than it doesn‚Äôt do the EKG, it does everything my 7 does for 1/3 of the price."
Sparky,This made a great Christmas gift for my significant other. She absolutely loves the color and design. I do wish this had the option to ship with the smaller band as she has very petite wrists.
Seth,it did not come the the c adapter to charge the phone . nor was there any heads up that i would have to buy one
Amazon Customer,Had to wait to give  a review so far everything is working as should no complications with the watch the the shipment was fast and personally delivered. So it's all 5 stars for me
Guy Velo,"I got this watch for a very affordable price as a Christmas gift. While it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt light up all the time, I‚Äôm happy as it gives me privacy and improves the battery life. As an introduction into Apple Watch, this is a great watch to start."
Amazon Customer,"La compatibilidad que tiene con el iPhone es excelente, adicional la bater√≠a y comodidad le da un valor agregado"
Amazon Customer,this watch is perfect i‚Äôve had an apple watch before but broke it and needed a new one. i was a little worried ordering it from amazon but it‚Äôd exactly the same came in an apple box and everything there‚Äôs no difference at all ordering it from amazon than from apple. i love my apple watch!
Alejandro,Great product except for the short battery life.
Alejandro,"The battery lasts for about 2 days with everything turned off and minimal use, less than a day with every function on. I feel like we can do better, but here we are. I like it and basically use it to track exercise, steps, and sleep. It seems to be pretty accurate. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll replace it when it doesn‚Äôt update anymore."
VCP,"It definitely worth it. This is my first Apple Watch, and I'm so happy about it. It's very convenient, easy to wear. The battery last around 36 hours. Unfortunately, this model doesn't have the electrocardiogram feature. I was looking forward to it.If you're looking for an apple watch, and it's gonna be your first one, the SE2 Apple watch is for you."
Greg Bailey,100% nuevo
Onelia O.,"Overall I love the watch, I love that you can alert your phone from it if you misplaced your phone, you can answer calls on it.My only dislike is having you write out your text messages, definitely would be so much better even with a T9 keyboard!"
Daisy9552,"1st apple watch so I do not have anything to compare it to. Watched a lot of videos about comparing the SE, #8 and Ultra. Chose the SE for the lower cost and the others had extra features that I could live without. I have been wanting an apple watch for ever! I am very pleased with my purchase and I can not wait to see what apps I can put to use."
DN,"I had Apple Watch 6 (40mm) stainless steel. It looks good but very heavy for that size and the pointy bottom with sensor was breaking my wrist. So I bought this same size model of SE2.It looks and feels the same as 6. But lighter. Not too much 15g or so. But it gives not as much pressure on the wrist. I prefer Samsung watches‚Äô bottom as they are flatter. But last couple of their iterations do not sync with iPhone.SE2 is much faster in everything. You can see it fly through everything.Battery is not good. Even though this doesn‚Äôt have always on function, if you wear 12hr or more you will need to charge it. Not good.Strap is mine. But this strap is lighter than the one comes with the watch.But at $250 I‚Äôm not complaining.So buy it"
Shawn R,"Upgraded from Apple Watch 3 42mm. I was doing in that watch everything, taking shower, washing dishes, swimming in lakes and in the ocean. Finally they died after I did a scuba dive recently  for 30ft or 10-12 meters :) I opened it to see what is going on inside and was shocked. Th3 watch was so heavily damaged by rust and corrosion inside, lots of leakage. I have to say I am surprised they survived for such a long time. Though Apple say it is water resistant up to 50 meters it looks it is not, so take care of your watch."
Sparky,Nice
hank,"My series 3 watch was showing its age. I finally broke down and replaced it with this. It‚Äôs a huge upgrade to my series 3 and for considerably less than a series 8. I can‚Äôt complain, I knew I was giving up some features to the 8 but I couldn‚Äôt justify the extra expense. I love my SE."
mustafa curry,"Bought as a gift and they loved it. We set everything up very quickly, app makes it super easy. The color is stunning and face is easy to read. I don‚Äôt know about battery life but Apples are all about the same. Do more things wear down battery quicker. Nice watch."
Alfonso Enriquez Castro,"The Apple Watch SE is great, considering it can do most of the things the higher tier watches (like the Series 7 & 8) can do for this price, especially when you consider that this watch has almost the same specs as the Series 8. You don‚Äôt miss out on too much except for the ability to see your blood oxygen and ECG, along with temperature sensing and an always-on display. In other words, if those features don‚Äôt matter that much to you, this could be your best choice for your wallet."
Mateo,"Should have updated a few years ago, glad I finally got around to doing so. So happy that I chose to go up in size to the 44mm. Wondered if it would be too large on my wrist, but I love the slightly oversized look. For reference I have the S/M band and it's closed on the second hole from the top. Using the apps is much easier on the 44mm too."
madyson brooks,Battery life is horrible. Step tracking is very inaccurate.
Tom Costello,The watch has great features but battery life is poor. I guess that‚Äôs a trade-off.
aparke,"I had a Fitbit, which I enjoyed, but I wanted to upgrade to an Apple Watch. I love this watch! It does so much more than my Fitbit. My favorite thing is being able to take a phone call from it so my hands are free!"
Manuel Patino,"My wife has some trouble with all that her new Apple watch does, but the joy of having it overcomes the learning curve. She has family and trip pictures scrolling across the face of the watch, and she is always showing the pictures to others. I am tickled to see her finding such joy in her Apple watch."
Jimmy Cordero Razon,I bought it for my husband ad Christmas present. He loves it. It not the latest model but he just want something he can check his email or text messages without looking at his phone.
Gabrielle Disney,"The reason I wanted an Apple Watch was mainly for the fall detection as I live alone, and I fell a few weeks ago in my back bedroom and luckily I wasn‚Äôt injured and I was able to get up but while I laid there on the floor it dawned on me, what if I couldn‚Äôt get up. So that‚Äôs when I decided I needed to invest in an Apple Watch because it has the fall detection, I can make a call and have someone come over to help me. It‚Äôs just a great thing to have as it gives me a feeling of security since I live alone."
Shawn R,"I ordered 2 watches but when I ordered the second one I also ordered a usb charger. Turned out the charger included with the watch doesn‚Äôt work. I plugged it in to my computer, my phone, and my flashlight. Nothing worked. The usb charger worked perfectly"
Sparky,Purchased one for our oldest son. Good price point with features compared to the latest version of the Apple Watches. So happy with it that I bought another one for my wife.
USS Freight lines Inc,"I personally have never been disappointed by any Apple products. The watch is no exception. I use it mostly as a backup for my iPhone. I don‚Äôt miss calls, email, texts or alarms. Since I am often not sure where I left my phone that is very handy. I bought the SE because it was the most reasonable priced. I‚Äôm glad I did."
Ijakdo,"Apple is too cheap to add a special USB-C charging block to their packaging, so buy one Separately, or you will have the same type of Christmas I did. No one deserves that. Asinine apple.  I‚Äôm giving most of this five stars because this is an Amazon bought product.  And Amazon does not deserve the rating of one star Apple does."
Ijakdo,I really like this watch. It keeps the time accurately. I can talk on it as well as get alerts on it. I can accessorize it with multiple bands. Great value.
Andrew,I love I can respond to text messages by speaking into the watch. I love all the apps this was definitely a great upgrade.
Shilpi,"I was a little worried based on the other reviews but I love this watch! It's come in handy and it works very well, I kind of forget I'm wearing it. Highly recommend."
Breakin80,"Love my Apple Watch.  I bought it for Fall Detection, but have found lots of other useful features.  Much cheaper in the long run than ‚ÄúHelp, I‚Äôve fallen and I can‚Äôt get up‚Äù devices.iPhone locator, timer, reminder alarms, ‚Äúwhere am I?‚Äù  Plus, it‚Äôs always with you ‚Äî right there on your wrist.My friends tell me that their watches (not from Amazon) came with two sizes of bands.  Wish mine had."
Lynyrd,"My husband bought me this for Christmas to replace my second gen, which was 8 years old. Not much difference in style, face is a little larger. Synced with my iPhone easily and so many more functions. Truly a computer on your wrist. Easy to personalize to your style, you can use photos as your wallpaper."
Devin,"Product would not connect to IPhone 12, took to apple with no luck, returned to sender, will try again!"
Devin,I bought this just because my old one died.  BUT IT SAVED my life.  I was taking my dogs for a walk.  They got over excited about saying hi to some neighbors and pulled me down.  I blacked out for a second but came to when my watch started ringing and sent a message that it detected a fall and wanted to know if it should call 911.  I love this watch and will not leave the house without it.
Slf99,Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to operate and has a great battery life.
Najera,Had to return.  They wanted me to purchase a more expensive watch.
B. Anderson,Bought it for my wife as she wanted it for her birthday. I don't think any Apple item is worth the price they charge.
Shawn R,"Was debating the SE gen. 2 or the Series 8, and truly, aside of being aluminum instead of stainless steel, and lacking a pulse oximeter, this is the BEST! The price is more competitive and the features are incredible. Beats the Series 3 I've had for 4 years without a doubt, would highly recommend this over the Series 8 at this price. Using recycled materials to make this is a plus as well."
Sparky,Excelente compra
Nicole,Excelente producto
Dr. Richard Glasgow,Band can‚Äôt fit my wrist!
olivia walston,The SE is a great option. It has a lot of the utility of a smart watch for a great deal. This is quite useful for a student aged wearer.
Linda McGuire,I purchased this I watch to replace my previous one which the face had separated and it this cost the same as fixing the old oneLove it!
Linda L Preston,"Apple why wouldn't you include an adapter with watch?  You should list, it not including adapter a must purchase."
Boxman,This is about the same size as my 3 however the type and face font is larger and more user friendly. I love the settings and the new modular face watch.  works great no complaints.
Diane,"It‚Äôs my first Apple Watch. I always brought the cheaper sports watches. I love all the features. The only downside I‚Äôve noticed is the battery life doesn‚Äôt last long. Also you need to buy a power adapter, it doesn‚Äôt come with one. But other than that I‚Äôm happy with my purchase."
Diane,Purchased this watch for my spouse and they love it so far. They‚Äôve only had it for about a week and a half but hopefully it continues to be a good product for them.
Mary T.,Love the watch I never knew I really needed it. It‚Äôs fast battery life is great.
M. Northington,Tiny but convenient. The 44mm would be too big so we got the 40mm. We have small wrists. My all black one isn‚Äôt home yet since it was not in stock but my wife absolutely loves hers.
Mystiviolet,I bought it because I used to have a Fitbit watch but hated plugging it in each night. This Apple Watch I purchased a stand to hold and charge my phone and watch together easily each night. It‚Äôs fantastic for my needs.
Shawn R,Love it
Sparky,Todo el color es hermoso
Ana,"Es un Apple Watch SE GPS nuevo 2022.muy f√°cil de usar con la aplicaci√≥n del iPhone.Tiene un buen tama√±o puesto en mi mu√±eca .me gusta mucho mi reloj ya que puedo controlar mensajes ,llamadas y muchas aplicaciones mas por mi reloj."
anonymous,"She had wanted a fitbit‚Ä¶ i researched both and apparently made the perfect decision by getting the Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen! She loves it. Gets challenged to exercise every day, found her phone in no time, etc! Thank you!"
Maggie,Great overall watch!
Kahnisha Hernandez,I bought 2 .. one for me and my lady. They‚Äôre AWESOME! The price is great and the these new SE models are excellent! I wear mine everyday!
Devria,"This beautiful watch is locked and, therefore, not usable."
Madison Mills,Delivery was as promised. My wife loves her new watch.
Marilyn Fair,It was a gift. I wear it to get time of day. If you like gadgets it‚Äôs intetestimg if one has time to play. Wasn‚Äôt expensive and works for me.
Gary Barnett,"It's clean, beautiful, and practical. I'm in love with it. Battery life is not excellent but makes it through 1 day and a half."
Rafael A.,"                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†I love how simple the SE watch is. I have the 45mm and can‚Äôt say nothing but great things about it. I have had no issues, lagging or problems. I don‚Äôt think people need the Series 8 over this - but it all depends on your fitness and life goals."
Henry Hern√°dez,
Shawn R,It‚Äôs unfortunate that they didn‚Äôt state it worked with iPhone 8 or newer.  Wasted everyone‚Äôs time.
Sparky,Bought for my step daughter she loves it.
Alex Parrilla,"Although I'm a die hard android user,  my daughter is equally due hard Apple products. She is over the moon in love with her watch."
Margie Elmore,I‚Äôm 66 years old & I had no problem setting it up. Currently have a pix of my granddaughter as my watch face
Margie Elmore,First Apple watch for the wife. Didn't want to spend a fortune before I knew if she would like it. She loves it and it does most of the things the new expensive ones do.
Stacy M.,Bought this for my bride for Christmas. She never asked for one and didn‚Äôt think she wanted one but absolutely loves it. Great gift for anyone with an iPhone.
Marie,Perfect for my needs
Pam,"The Apple Watch is amazing! Can‚Äôt stop recommending this watch. The only small thing that kind of sucks is the battery life. I have to charge it almost everyday. I work intensely for almost 12hrs per day, so I like to keep tracking of the amount of steps I walk per day. However, I couldn‚Äôt finish the 12hrs because the battery lasts around 10hrs if you turn the power-saving mode around 50%."
Mom ,I bought this in 40mm with a midnight sport band. Clearly said midnight sport band however it came with a blue grayish sports band strap. The weird thing is that the case read midnight sport band but still didn‚Äôt have it. Oh and i bought 2 of them as well.
Tia,"Got this for my wife, who uses an iPhone. It feels very solidly made, with nothing aesthetically standing out as an imperfection. The watch seems snappy, with a good easy to use interface. The only complaint she's had is that the speech to text recognition is awful, and I've seen a number of posts online with the same complaint and it seems to be consistent across all apple devices? Certainly not a dealbreaker but seems like something that could potentially improve with software updates (if they get to it)."
yadira h.,"Bought this to replace a older version from 5 years ago, not sure what has been upgraded. It seems like the same watch with no changes. Now I have 2."
Mark Khosho,Thought she would never really go for such a thing but she uses it daily and lives it.
Joshua Garner,The battery life in this Apple Watch is honestly the best! I would totally recommend this Apple Watch in particular.
Shawn R,"much appreciated no hassles, exactly what I ordered and perfect condition as advertised."
Sparky,The Apple Watch comes on time for my wife Christmas gift. It is not unbox yet. I love the Apple Watch Se. the series 8 has much health care which she does not need. So I think SE should be the best for her.
Msfreqflyr,My son has several watches. Wears this one daily.
Stuff62,"Its exactly as pictured, came brand new in the apple box. Charger was included! It was easy to connect it to my phone and it has all the apps I need! I absolutely love it, its great for working out and its waterproof like it says. I highly recommend this watch! I just recently purchased some screen protectors for it to prevent scratching it too (bc I‚Äôm clumsy) But definitely worth the investment if you‚Äôre thinking about getting an Apple Watch!"
Mhayling G.,"                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†Me encanto mi Apple Watch..tengo experiencia porque ten√≠a un serie 3 pero este SE evidentemente es mejor en cuanto configuraci√≥n,pantalla etc. Es totalmente nuevo con bater√≠a en 100 de capacidad.. Estoy satisfecha tNto con mi paquete q con elEnv√≠o,el cual fue maravilloso por la amabilidad del driver y la rapidez delmismo"
olga marquez,Love my watch it keeps track of everything.
RGJ4,This watch is awesome and simple to use right out of the box. I love the features. It‚Äôs comfortable and has unlimited potential.
A. Griffith,They have yet to re fund my money. U returned this item a month ago and have not received my money back and to be honest Amazon is not helping at all i am kinda pissed off.This came fast never opened the box because I ordered the wrong watch as it didn't have cellular only gps
Shamar Davis,Works great. My husband loves it. I have one too and it love it.
Shamar Davis,"I absolutely love this watch.  As a person that has had a couple of Fitbit & loved them but wanted more features, this is terrific.  This watch has so much for & as a senior, I also wanted fall detection which this has.  I got another fall detection watch that was hard to use & lacking all the fitness features. This combines the best of health, fitness & safety. A good price point since I can‚Äôt afford the more expensive Apple watches."
Terri F,The watch works perfectly fine. I am in love with it. I highly recommend
Randall Wright,Great
Jamroe (Joe and Mary),Exactly what my mom wanted!
Shawn R,Battery lasts days. Came in so quick! I‚Äôm in love with this series!
Sparky,Awsome gift he loves it
Priscilaoliveira ,"Believe it or not, I replaced my apple watch 1 with this model. This one's (SE2) screen is a bit larger but not by much. In my opinion these watches are well worth the money. BTW get a screen cover."
David S,My daughter is very happy with this item. No complaints.
Melissa Brakstad,The SE has almost all the features of the Apple Watch 8 at a fraction of the price.
Melissa Brakstad,I'm not a techno guy.  Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  Said it worked with the iPhone SE.  Problem was her phone was a first gen iPhone SE.  Obviously we needed to upgrade phones so we did that.  But the watch needs charged just about every day.  Very disappointed in battery life.
William R Wilson,Awesome Cyber Monday find! My son was shocked & loves it! Great quality.
Amazon Customer,I love my new Apple Watch its so convenient running everything I need on it from my wrist. The battery life is the only think I‚Äôd criticize it really only lasts 30 hours or so it needs to be charged daily pretty much
Dawn Poole,"I'm only giving this part starts. It does make me very mad I go to set up watch and Apple gives you a cord but no way to charge the phone. The plug you need is their newest plug. Come on Apple, Jobs would be ashamed of you. I have to now drive over 30 miles to get a plug"
Amazon Customer,"It was a gift, she loves it."
Jim A,Works well
Homeowner,"Tal y como en las fotos, producto original de la Apple."
Linda A.,It is easy to set up and use I have very small wrists and it doesn‚Äôt look big on my arm .
Shawn R,I needed a new watch and this works out great. The battery needs to be charged often but overall a great buy.
Sparky,Just what I had expected. Good packaging and new
Lucas,Its much better than my old series 3. No issues here. Great experience with seller
Reu,Easy yo use
Reu,"I love the watch, it's super useful and easy to use, plus it motivates you to be on the move. My only problem is that the strap barely closes and I will have to buy another one so that my wrist does not continue to suffer. I was hoping it would be bigger or have more holes."
andy,The product worked well for the grandson.
D Thomas,So far it‚Äôs working well and I‚Äôm pleased. Definitely a good compromise price wise if you don‚Äôt need the blood oxygen level or body temperature options that the series 8 has.I‚Äôll update if anything changes or if it quits working as it should.
Thomas Bruley,                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†It was delivered super fast thanks
Jayden,"Delivery was very effecient and the Apple Watch lives up to the quality which we have become accustomed too. In my opinion, it's the best smart watch on the market, especially when paired with an apple watch."
Jayden,great watch
Frank James Cheff,"Band will not stay fastened and falls off frequently, causing it to shatter"
Michael Wo,"Iba a comprarlo en apple directamente , me compre el de 44mm, en apple me costaba aprox 310 d√≥lares, aqu√≠ me costo 239 porque le bajaron el precio. Es completamente original, viene todo sellado, es nuevo. 100% RECOMENDADO"
NJ Grandmother,Love the apple watch!
Brianna White,"Excelente producto, lo recomiendo"
Brianna White,Like it so far. Just start using so am not sure about battery life
Shawn R,"Loved it , but would not pair with my 7+ phone"
Sparky,Did not have Alexa no ekg for heart no oxygen have to purchase app to 9.99 month
Lilieth Ramos,Simplemente perfecto!
Alejandra Soto,Got this for my boyfriend's birthday. He loves it. Wears it everyday and it's super useful
Jayson & Jennifer Lyons,Price to high
