Frogroast,"I have been looking into this watch for a bit as I like the looks and size of the piece. I finally made the purchase as the price was right during Prime Days. It was shipped and received promptly so that was good. Then I ran into the issues. I have a Google Pixel that I was pairing to so I thought that the Wear OS would sync right away, unfortunately that was not the case. After roughly three hours, many resets, deleting and reloading the apps I was able to connect. It did seem to perform well and the resolution was very clear.I used this for several exercises over the few days I had it. The first activity was kayaking, There was not a specific kayak sport in the activity list so I selected rowing. I was surprised that this activity did not use the GPS rather it only tracked the time.I then used it for a bike ride and the GPS was enabled when using that activity feature. After stopping the activity when I returned home it took quite a while to sync with the third party Strava app. Reviewing the stats of the ride the GPS track was very scattered. The track did not match the ride. Day two I decided to run this and my old watch to compare the results. Again, the TicWatch track was very scattered and didn't match the actual route. My older watch tracked consistent to the actual route as well as previously loaded routes. I was also disappointed with the in activity display as key features were not prominent to view.Having encountered these issues in the first three days soured my opinion and I decided to return and look to a Garmin equivalent (Venu 2). We'll see how that turns out.So, pros and cons from my short time with this watch""Pros:- Look and feel - It is a nice looking watch with a big face and low profile.- Screen resolution- Answering calls was nice, but not a deal breakerCons:- Set up, this could have been an issue just for me but it did not give a first impression- GPS tracking was not accurate- Water rating - This wasn't a deal breaker but a few of its competitors have better ratings- The need to run two apps (Wear OS and Mobvoi) is a bit clumsy and disconnected.I'm giving it a middle of the road rating as it just didn't work out and make great first impressions for me."
superbrain,"Mobvoi has outdone themselves again with the new Ticwatch 3. I've been using Ticwatches since the original Ticwatch and manages to maintain all of the cutting edge features with the Ticwatch Pro 3. Finally an ambient display which dramatically saves battery life and tells time!The battery life easily lasts me throughout a full day (usually lasts about 2-3 days depending on use) with the standard sensors and moderate use. The watch itself is extremely lightweight and very comfortable. Hardware holds up well since the watch is responsive and have no experienced a single hiccup. Screen is sharp and looks great, and the ability to take calls with the built in speaker and microphone make it the perfect all rounder smart watch.All the sensors seem to accurately report metrics which may be of interest if you're into that kind of thing, the sleep monitoring functions are also extremely useful which expand its usefulness as a 24/7 health and fitness utility.Also the watch looks really sexy."
jack,"I bought this to upgrade from my perfectly capable Ticwatch E3.This feels faster, battery lasts longer and the additional software updates are really good. The dual screen feature is great.The screen is larger (at least things like the pin keyboard seems easier to use) and is ready to be read in bright sunlight.  Case seems tough and the strap is thicker than the E3.I would only make one suggestion to the Mobvoi team: include more than one charging cable, nice to have a spare at the office or in the travel kit even if the battery lasts a long time.This watch seems to be a capable Wear OS device.  I am hoping it gets the version 3 OS soon."
Nicholas Su,"I've loved a few previous models from TicWatch and this one is no exception.  It is noticeably thinner than the previous model.  This one does not have a compass and does have a thicker band.  But it still has great battery life, which is why I picked TicWatch originally.  Even with the always-on screen (but with tilt-to-wake turned off), it usually uses less than 25% of the battery from when I wake up to when I go to bed.  This is with not-heavy use, but using the timer once or twice per day, paying for things at the store using the watch, checking phone notifications and reminders throughout the day from the watch, etc.  As an experiment, I didn't charge it one night, and the battery was still over 40% at the end of the second day.  The watch is generally very responsive to touch gestures (but the unlock pattern sometimes doesn't respond at first, for a couple seconds)."
Nicholas Su,"With so many other informative reviews I'll keep this simple.Overall, this is a fantastic smartwatch, and the best I've ever owned. I have most of the constant sensors turned off. Pedometer turned on, and notifications from texts and other apps on. Battery lasts about 2 days on average. Way better than other watches I've had that wouldn't even make it through the day. Essential mode is fantastic. Went 3 days on essential mode and it was still at over 80% battery.WARNING: IP68 rating is great, but apparently is not meant for the ocean. I swam in the ocean a little on vacation, with NO constant or deep submersion, and now my speaker is damaged. Still makes noise, but it's all metallic and sounds like a tin can rattling.Great watch, take it off if you go to the beach. I wish they clarified the waterproofing a bit more. I figured if you can swim a while in the pool with it, a little bit of ocean swimming would be fine. Guess not."
Sean,I have used Ticwatch since the original was on kickstarter. It’s arguably the best google wear watch you can get. It’s durable and has good build quality. It has great software and it compliments google wear OS very well. All in all I highly recommend this watch.
E. Jacobs,"Had the original Tic watch pro finally upgraded after 3 plus years and it's well worth the upgrade. The back lit essential screen is a godsend and was greatly needed. Response is pretty snappy.. Way more snappy than what I had so to me it's really snappy. The heart rate monitor is solid. Overall, it's a good choice and definitely an upgrade for me."
R. Swope,"I have mixed impressions about this watch.Pros:1. Battery life is amazing, it easily runs for 3 full days with GPS on every day for about an hour.2. The 2nd display is very visible under any light conditions and with customizable backgrounds (you can pick, I believe 8 or 9 different colors) you’d have plenty of choice3. App is relatively user-friendly, no complains there as wellCons:1. Big one for me – the watch constantly skips night sleep recording, on average once or twice per week. So, if it’s important to you – pick another watch.2. It still runs WearOS 2.0 with all the promises to get upgraded to 3.0 in “the second part” of 2022. I believe, eventually it will. WearOS, at least in theory, promises more battery life by optimizing the background apps usage.*I received this watch as part of a promotion for free. But I expressed my true observations and impressions"
Ryan H,"So this is my third ticwatch and by far my favorite. Going back to the pro with the overlapping always on display has been such a welcome change! After first charge I wore it for 2 days straight without ever getting to essential mode, which will increase longevity of battery. The screen is vivid and responsive, love the backlit always on display, a great addition. Now with 24 hr pulse and blood oxygen monitoring on the battery was at 40% after two full days and a night of wear, which is great. The sleep monitoring visibility isn't great on watch but once in the app it translates very well, easily viewed for daily, weekly and monthly. Overall the app is a great companion to track activity, sleep and heart rate. Coming from the TicWatch E3, which I was a decent watch, I'm thrilled with this new device. Being the Pro it does feel slightly bulkier right off but not terribly and it feels great being worn. Tic exercise has always been a pretty good app and with the monitoring on, that app kicks on automatically when heart rate starts to elevate so you don't even have to put effort into tracking your exercise. The one negative I've had with last couple of TicWatch products I've had is the charging station. It's not something that sits flat on it's own or fits around watch so you literally need to place it on the watch to charge and train the cable to work for your needs. Minor issue for sure but that charger is a dinky little thing. I'm really impressed with the new TicWatch Pro 3 ultra and would definitely recommend."
D. Orr Jr.,"I was a previous Samsung Galaxy Watch user, and before that i had a Moto 360.The first thing i notice when i got the watch is that the feeling wasn't that premium like my previous smartwatches, mainly because this one have a plastic body and those had a Stainless steel  construction.I have several watchbands to switch from my previous ones, but i feel like i cant be switching them that much, because the pin holes are plastic and the border can be broken and that's the end of the watch.The addition is the second secreen it's a great feature because you can save a lot of battery and still be able to look the time all the time instead of an empty black screen, or the need to use an Always On display face. The only downside that I've found with it, is that it adds a silver like layer on top of the amoled screen, so blacks don't look deep black like they have to, but more like satin black. Still, that's nitpicking for a downside.Battery life is good, not great. I'm use to a 3 days battery life with my previous Galaxy Watch, and this one have around the same duration. This was the first reason why I don't upgrade to a Galaxy Watch 4 Classic; that and because it's smaller and I like big watches.WearOS is great, you have a lot of apps and watchfaces, and I was able to use my previous ones with the same facer and watchmaker apps that I was using on the GW with Tizen instead of Wear OS.Call quality is good, and the ability to record voice notes on it is great. Volume is adequate and the quality of the mic is good. You can hear and be heard without a problem.Notifications are customisable and your able to answer messages from the watch via predefined texts, writing your own, or using google voice typing wich is the best, since the keyboard on it, it's pretty small and I have big hands.Another downside is that it uses a magnetic charging cable instead or QI charging, so no wireless charging on the go with my phone. But the cable is good and easy to find 3rd party cables that fits.So far so good. I installed a stainless steel band and it looks more casual that sporty,Besides that, i think is a nice watch with a cool design, and I'm waiting for the Wear OS 3 update once Samsung's embargo finish.Can't tell that much about the sensors, because I don't use them a lot, but on my testings they were accurate, also the GPS.Updatev 07/08/2022Only downside so far its that it doesn't show WhatApp calls on the watch screen. Seem like call support it's only available to regular operator calls and not apps calls like Meet, Teams or whatsapp calls.Also that we're half way 2022, and we're still waiting for the Wear OS 3.0 update.Update : April 7.Since last week, the essential mode it's not working anymore, so i had to activate the ambient mode to have a constant hour face.2023 and Still, no Wear Os 3...Just like MKBHD says: NEVER BUY A PRODUCT BASED ON A PROMISE OF A FUTURE FEATURE.Mi 1st and last TicWatch. Going back to Samsung... At least the last one died after almost 3 years of use. This one doesn't have a year and it's already failing. Plus, the charging cable it's a little finicky. It connects and sometimes won't charge."
RD,"This is my first WearOS watch. I had a simple one that used to last me three or four weeks without having to charge, so going from that to every two or three days is an adjustment. It was one I was willing to endure in exchange for increased functionality. I wanted to be able to answer the phone with my watch. It will pick up the call and immediately send it to my phone. Now it doesn't even alert me to my calls, and I have only had this phone five weeks. It is not user friendly. There aren't troubleshooting tips in the manual, and nothing online. I'm stuck with an expensive watch that does the same that my $45 watch did.I don't know if the watch is defective or if I'm just not as smart as this smartwatch. The only things I like about it are that it has a good selection of watch faces. I don't like that it lights up every time I move at night when I'm sleeping. I don't like that when the alerts work they work in the middle of the night as well. I do like that there are two faces, so you don't HAVE to turn on the watch face to check the time. I don't like that the watch pokes into my hand. I don't like that there is no way to get tech support or customer service on this watch and the videos on YouTube all show the same thing - so apparently I'm the only one who is dealing with this.The upgrade to a better watch was a gift, but I would have been satisfied with a much less expensive watch that just tracked my steps, sleep, heartrate, oxygen and time and set off alarms and only had to be charged once or twice a month. When this watch dies, I will go back to simple."
Casey,"Among Wear OS watches, this is among the best. The interface is snappy and the battery life will easily go 2+ days with the low-power display for AOD.  The screen is large and vibrant, and though the monochrome lcd is a bit limited in utility its worth the battery and at least it gives color options.App compatibility is also great with play store support, and i don't notice any issues with consistency of updating the time. (unlike my samsung watch)Scheduled essential mode is also a great way to save battery overnight without needing to think about it. The main sticking point of this is that if you use the watch for sleep tracking it will disrupt that. And if you have a screen lock you'll need to unlock it in the morning before you get your notifications or apps run. This is a deal breaker if you rely on a 3rd party watch app for your alarms. Its a neat feature but it doesn't fit my needs.The speaker's also great, and better than any watch i've used before. Probably because there's enough room in this thing for a decent one. If i had any complaint about it it may be the haptics, which are a bit louder than apple and samsung's watches.This really feels like a watch made with as few compromises as possible, and with the promise of Wear OS 3.0 i only expect it to get better. Not every feature is perfect for me, but there's enough features here that it very well may be the best smartwatch for you."
Kikemotions,"I have been using this watch for a few weeks. I am very impressed with this watch. The size is perfect for me. Power will easily last for 3 - 4 days in smart mode. There is another essential mode with basic information if you want to extend the battery life further. You can schedule switching between smart mode and essential mode.The TicExcercise and TicHealth apps are very good. After an exercise, we get a detailed summary.  We can see previous activity information in TicHealth App. TicExercise is easily accessible from the bottom button (which you can customize in settings).Ticwatch has its own watch face store called Timeshow which has a good variety of watch faces. Overall I like this watch. I hope it will get WearOS 3.0."
Kikemotions,"If your looking for a Google OS Wear watch, this is the best for the money. The reason for 4 stars is, any watch with OS Wear has terrible battery life, HUAWEI and amazfit and others offer 14 days and 7 to 8 days with AOD, this watch will give you 2 days with AOD and around 5 days without it, that’s why I don’t like OS Wear, they’re a hog on battery. I have read that ticwatch is introducing a new Pro 4 after the new year that’s feature the new Qualcomm chip that will offer twice the battery life, but they are slow to update and implement so time will tell, if this proves true and they can offer 5 to 6 days with AOD, I’ll consider buying one."
Frogroast,"PROS:Outstanding battery lifeEasy access to over 90 exercise appsBright dual display with optional tilt to wake and always onUp to date technology including gps is fastFairly rapid chargingEasy wear os setupAccess to current appsExcellent rugged looksConsStill wishing for wireless chargingSamsung and Google still have lock on wear OS 3 but it will be updated soonSo many features it takes time to learnAs a user of a Samsung Galaxy watch (new version) I decided to try the TicWatch Pro Ultra GPS (“TW”). There are things I like about this watch that are simply not available on the Galaxy watch. Notably the dual display fits my needs better than the Galaxy. The TW has a battery large enough to grant three days of run with full use and longer if put into essential mode. The watch is rugged, complying with military specs that ensure shock and temperature resistance to extreme environments. It is also water resistant to 1.5 meters (about 5 ft). It is made with gorilla glass that is also protected by a non rotating watch bezel. After a two months of use the watch does not have the slightest mark on it.Operating the watch takes a little time to learn but is not difficult. Operation is fast using the 4100 processor with no noticeable difference when compared to the Galaxy. TW provides about 90 different forms of exercise tracking built in. One can also utilize the Google exercise apps. The GPS worked reasonably well when tracking exercise. TW exercise apps can be accessed pushing the lower of the two functional buttons. The top button illuminates the second display and pushing a second time accesses installed apps. There is ample memory for app storage. The LCD style display is always and is backlit to the color of your choice with a tilt of the wrist. If the need arises the LCD can be turned off and the watch reverts to a standard single display watch. It will soon be upgraded to wear os 3.The TW also has the ability to take and make phone calls. It sports a heart rate monitor SPO2 measurement, AFIB detection, and physical/mental fatigue detection.This is simply the best watch available currently. It is my new go to watch."
superbrain,"I've enjoyed watching the progression of smart watches from Mobvoi over the years and own several of their pieces. The 4G LTE was my daily go-to watch and with the Pro 3 Ultra GPS using a similar LCD panel over the smartwatch panel I'm already seeing fantastic battery life. As with all of these feature watches, the more features you use the less battery life you'll see. With the active heart monitoring enabled, and most other features, I've used about 30% battery in the 24 hours I've been using the watch. With my 4G LTE model I kept most functions turned off and saw, on average, two weeks of battery life, and I hope for the same with this model. The upgraded storage and processor make the watch really great to use.From a user experience perspective, having many functions attached to the top right button is less ideal (for example, pressing it, holding it for 3, 5 or 10 seconds, all do different things). The microphone and speaker on the watch perform alright, but the speaker is not high quality and you'll want to pair your own headphones or use the watch to control music through your phone if you're concerned about quality of sound. Still, it's great to have access to a microphone for recording voice notes to yourself on the watch and the microphone picks up your voice very well from a foot away.The range of ""Tic"" apps is pretty great, and includes some new apps that I hadn't seen before such as a noise sensor to detect the amount of ambient noise, an app to guide you through breathing exercises, and more. These are great touches for mental health and relaxation.The band that ships with the watch is definitely made for larger wrists, and the face of the watch is larger than the 4G LTE model. It also introduces me to my third Mobvoi proprietary charging plug, I would much prefer to see a unified charging plug of some sort. I'm hoping Mobvoi will release a branded mountable charger as the magnetic USB cables can have a tendency to fall off, though the magnets in the Pro 3 Ultra GPS model seem to be stronger so it should last longer.I'll likely pick up a screen protector of some sort and would like to see this ship as a standard feature in smartwatches to protect against accidental bumps and scratches."
Claudia,****** updated**** customer services said I can send it back for a warranty claim. They were very nice but unfortunately when my bag arrived back from my trip it was stolen along with a charger for my girlfriends Fitbit..... updating review because they have top notch customer service and I did enjoy the watch when it worked. Just make sure you don't swim with it......It says swimming friendly. Went for a swim in a pool while on vacation and now the sensors don't work. DO NOT GET IT WET!
Anonymously,"The build quality is very nice. It's a solid watch, but it doesn't feel heavy. It feels like it could survive quite a few drops or uncontrolled arm movements in tight spaces. I like the standard wrist strap even though my wrist is between snug and loose.I like that the display is very clear. That's important when looking at information on a small screen. All of the animations are very smooth with no slow-down, which probably means the processor is quite powerful.There are many available monitoring and lifestyle features. My guess is that Mobvoi put in enough sensors so that Wear OS can take advantage.Now onto the everyday use...it does everything. I rarely need to look at my phone because notifications pop up on the watch. I can even respond using the watch if I want. I use it to track weather, steps, heart rate, workouts, and sleep. I haven't tried yet but it can also track oxygen saturation. This means I don't need a separate fitness tracker/band. For all of this to work you probably think I'm charging at least once per day...nope!The battery life is much better than I expected. I had previous Wear OS watches that would last almost a day before needing a charge. They would charge quickly but it was annoying to have to think about my watch usage and possibly charging on the go. I can track multiple workouts, use 24hr heart rate monitoring, sleep monitoring, and general time and notification checks, and I don't have to charge for days...meaning more than one. I think I'm averaging 3 days on a charge and the key has got to be the dual screens. Most of the time the low power screen is on, which shows plenty of information, even during a workout. It also has a backlight, with color options, so I can see it in the dark. I just tap it to see the full-color display when I need to.If you want to see the full-color display more, you definitely can, and you'll probably have shorter battery life. But I think you'll be pleasantly surprised how little you need the full color display even though you can do so much with the watch.Nice job Mobvoi."
Ranjith,"Que buen reloj, me ha servido incluso para usos a mar abierto y sin problema alguno. Llevo con él varios meses bajo estás pruebas de agua constantes y todo ha ido perfecto. La batería realmente me dura poco más de 24 horas, diría yo que a buen uso unas 31 horas, me gustaría realmente que durará un poco más. La carga del reloj ha sido una pesadilla, no contar con carga rápida afecta mucho quedarte sin el reloj dos horas o más y bueno, la carga por pines me parece muy obsoleta, realmente no cuento con un puerto USB cerca y cargarlo con el celular vía NFC podría aliviarme muchos dolores de cabeza. Aprecio demasiado la pantalla, que resistente! Ni un rasguño (lo tengo sin protector de vidrio desde que lo compré), me preocupa la velocidad en la que se activa el WiFi cuando está fuera de rango el Bluetooth, es bastante lento el cambio de conectividad. En fin, buen reloj. A la espera de wear os 3.0!! Que sucede? por qué tanta demora? Saludos."
chawk20,"I want to start off by saying that my connection with the ""Tic"" brand and Mobvoi runs pretty deep. I first heard about them in 2018 on both Kickstarter and Indiegogo where they were campaigning for the Ticwatch 2 and TicPods, respectively. Flash forward to today and I still continue to use my TicPods as backup earbuds and the new TicWatch 3 improves on everything great about the Ticwatch 2.I will gear my review from the perspective of someone going from the TicWatch 2 to the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS.I can't stress how impressive the battery life is on the Pro 2, getting 3 days on a single charge feels like a godsend after dealing with daily charging on the previous model. The essential mode (dual Screen) is also great as I have managed to literally squeeze out days from my Pro 3 with only minimal battery percent lost when bouncing between both modes.Performance on the Pro 3 is silky smooth. I had no trouble sliding between apps and screen menu and it all looked great on the AMOLED display. The step, heats rate, oxygen, GPS, and NFC sensors all felt fast and responsive. Using Google pay on the watch has become a favorite feature of mine as I didn't have this option available on the previous model. Unfortunately, I cant say much about the sleep tracking as I find sleeping with any watch on too uncomfortable. Mobvoi apps have come a long way and I can confidently say I now use them as my main trackers. I've come to really enjoy the ecosystem they offer, but having access to the full Wear OS & Google Play Store is a game changer.In terms of aesthetics, while I like the more minimal look of the previous model I found the look and feel of the Pro 3 more than acceptable. It has a more hybrid workout look which is fine. The included rubber watch band is comfortable but definitely feels more geared towards larger wrist, however, the quick-release straps makes swapping it out a non-issue. The watch looks like a premium product and can easily be used for working out and dressing up."
The cheap photographer,"Overall rating for the watch is a solid 4.5/5. I've used ticwatch before and am very familiar with it. Here is a list of pro and cons.Pros-- The combo between the two screens is amazingly innovative and does wonders for the battery. I took it out of the box and used it regularly for three days before having to charge it. You don't usually get things like that on a smartwatch.- The controls on the watch are easy to use and very intuitive.-The fitness software is good, keeps track of what you get done with a full breakdown.- There is a variety of watch faces that are available to use so it keeps the watch entertaining.- Battery life is sufficient, last a good 4 days on a full charge when using apps such as fitness tracking, Spotify, etc.Cons-- watch is a little bulky then I would like.- software can lag from time to time when using for an extended period of time."
The cheap photographer,"My first smartwatch was a Ticwatch Pro 2020 and this watch is a natural progression that ensures that this line of watches stays near, or at, the top of the pack.Pros:- Battery: Depending on usage, the watch (while new at least, but my 2020 version held up well) will last for 3-4 days. The included low-power lcd display is a huge advantage here.-Health tracking: The included tracking apps are great for my occasional walks, runs, and hikes. I can’t speak to anyone doing closer or more detailed tracking, but my impression is that the apps on the watch have many features that will allow any user to get what they want from the software.-Style: If you want something thin and low profile, then this watch may not be for you, but if you don’t mind something on the bigger side, it’s a clean and modern looking watch that fits just about any watch and you might want. The included bands are great for both casual wear and exercise.Cons:- I wish that there was better integration between the health tracking and the Google suite of apps. Not all health details are readily accessible to Google apps (i.e., Fit), so you are locked into the Tic suite if you want to collect every bit of health data that you can- While I don’t mind the size during daily wear, the watch isn’t comfortable for overnight sleep tracking, in my opinion. I tried it out and the tracking works just fine, but the watch isn’t something that I can easily ignore when falling asleep."
Ian Douglas,"Cost vs Benefit is great but... can't seem to change the temperature from °F to °C even when I have set the settings/preferences on Wear Os, Google Assistant and in Chrome as °C... Haven't heard back from Mobvoi yet on how to fix this."
17blue_wrx,"I love the watch so far, I tried testing the battery since it's the most common issue I have with most smart tech and I was pleasantly surprised. If you use it in essential mode it will probably last you days on end no problem as just a watch (and a tracker cause it's still doing that in the background).But my first day I used it with everything on:Gps from phone and watch, tilt to wake screen, all trackers 24 hours , all the available processes I could get running at a time to see how well it would do. It actually lasted about 16 hours of pretty much non stop usage.My second day I tried everything on except GPS and tilt to wake .... everything else was running in the background and after the same 16 hours I had over 80% battery left!That being said everything else works great, my previous smartwatch was a ticwatch E3 which is already great but this one just feels a bit more sturdier and maybe better definition and smoother performance.Wear OS works easily, easy to customize, it has a water drainage button for when you use it under water. It's a really good smart watch is what I'm saying and keeps track of everything. (Oxygen levels, stress, heartbeat, sleep ...)"
K. Brooks,"Overall I like this watch. The dual screen is pretty cool to conserve battery life and the main screen is very vivid and easy to navigate. My biggest problem with this watch is sleep tracking is a complete joke. It is not accurate at all. It usually shows me more awake then asleep and doesn't even show accurate times that I went to sleep or woke up. I'm a very good sleeper and always get 7 to 8 hours every night. I almost never wake up in the middle of the night.  In the image I posted, I was in bed and fell asleep immediately at 8:30 p.m., then woke up at 4:00 a.m.  I used to have a Garmin Vivoactive 4 which had very accurate sleep tracking. The tick watch is pretty worthless so I don't even wear it anymore when I go to bed.Battery life is okay, but not the best. I'm used to my Garmin with 5 to 6 days of battery life. I get around 2 days with this watch which I guess is not bad with the full color display. If ticwatch could update the software for sleep tracking it would be a much better product."
Camilo Cortés,"I've had the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra for a week now and am beyond impressed with its performance, battery life, and durability.Performance:The TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra has a stellar performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100. Wear OS is smooth as butter and I experience little to no lag in opening and switching applications. Mobvoi has included my favorite apps, including Fit Breathe and TicHearing—applications that encourage me to be mindful of my wellbeing.Battery Life:Mobvoi's innovative dual screen technology enables the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra to deliver 3-45 days of battery. I appreciate the ability to turn on Essential Mode at times that I need to prioritize battery life while having access to some of the watch's features.  The TicWatch 3 Pro Ultra now features customizable backlight options, adding a personal touch to the dual screen technology that I love.Durability:The TicWatch 3 Pro Ultra has military-grade durability, putting my mind at ease when using the watch in a diverse set of outdoor conditions. The 1.4"" screen utilizes Corning Gorilla Glass, which helps keep the screen free of scratches. With durability in mind, I truly am able to take the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra wherever I go."
Kelvin Rodriguez,"I appreciate the ease of use with the watch, the  aesthetic design, and the battery life. It's definitely an awesome little smartwatch"
Kelvin Rodriguez,"The battery life on this thing is seriously amazing. I have been able to go easily 48hrs between charges, could probably get more out of it if I took advantage of some of the more advanced battery controls.One thing that is especially well done is the dual display. I no longer feel the need to have the main display always on as the secondary display is bright enough to read during the day and really helps extend the battery life.Beyond that, the integration with WearOS is probably the best it's even been in a TicWatch (I say this as someone who has been using these since the original TicWatch) and all of my Google apps work flawlessly on the large display."
Frogroast,"I have had a Ticwatch pro LTE for many years and have very much enjoyed it.  I decided to upgrade to the Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS and am very glad I did.  The device performs exactly as I wish , fulfilling all of my expectations.  The battery life is phenomenal .  I have become accustomed to charging my watch every day, and at first the new one would only be down to 90% for one day of my usage. Now I charge less often and the unit gets 5 days with power to spare.  I use the essential mode set to automatically operate during the night time hours, and still have access to all of the functions I need.  I have compared the sleep tracking results to those I get from my regular sleep tracking ring, with favorable outcomes. The watch is large enough to read easily, yet light enough to be almost unnoticeable during wear. The bluetooth function connects effortlessly, and I have made and received both calls and messages on the watch. I would recommend this device to anyone who is looking for a good smart-watch at a reasonable price!"
superbrain,"I also have a Ticwatch E3, so most of this review is going to be a comparison of the two. I like the decorative bezel on the Pro 3 Ultra. The display is a little larger than the E3, which is nice. I like that the band is a little stiffer as well. I think I got a little better battery life (~2 days) compared to the ~1.5 days with the E3. I wear the watch 24/7, so only remove it to charge it. I have an android phone and use the Sleep app overnight. I like that the charging port is on the side instead of the top like the E3...it makes it quicker/simpler to connect. I like that it uses the same charging cable as the E3, too. Lastly, the essential mode display has a lot of the information you need to view quickly without using as much battery. Changing the backlight color is a nice touch as well.My only dislike is that it doesn't have Wear OS 3 yet, but neither does the E3."
Amazon Customer,"This has been a great all-around watch.  It looks good at a formal event, and it looks good during active use - running, biking, volleyball, etc. (Very nice that it's waterproof as well).The shortcuts to workouts are really nice, even just logging a quick dog walk helps to keep track of what progress looks like for the day.Beyond the activity tracking, it's an excellent overall smart watch that was easy to setup, and does all the usual things you expect from WearOS.Battery life has been good, better than previous watches I've owned.  It's nice to have a little extra time to forget about charging it now and again.Ticwatch does the job of other smart watches at a lower price.  If you just need a good all-around watch, I highly recommend."
Brandon,"I unboxed this watch with much excitement. After setting it up and using it I have to say I am VERY pleased. A few things of note:1. Going from some of their other models the watch band is wider2. I had a little bit of difficulty getting the off-white calibration right, but after maybe 5 minutes of fiddling with it I haven't had any issues.3. On a positive note it is the same charger that they have been using with a good magnet strength.4. Another positive note is it doesn't seem to require the mobvoi app. I didn't mind the app, but I know that did turn some people off from their watches.Overall this watch is great and shows a very promising future for their product lines."
Esteban,"This is my third Ticwatch, and I can't say enough good things about the brand. First and foremost, I like the metal construction, definitely feels more rugged than something with plastic case. The battery life is absolutely fantastic, after a full day of use when I get home, I am generally still at 70% battery life and that is with always on display. There are way too many features for list, but the automatic exercise tracking is great, the blood oxygenation level is very accurate compared to the one of my doctor's office, sleep tracking works but I prefer not to sleep for the watch on. The standalone GPS is great for runs, bike rides, and hiking. One of the things I really like about this watch is when using essential mode, it is now backlit in multiple colors. This is extremely useful to me. As I said there are way too many feet to the list but for the things I use, they all work great and I can only see things getting better once Wear OS3 arrives."
Camilo Valencia,"I've owned a few TicWatch(es), specifically the GTX and the E3. I also used the Huawei Sport (Watch 2). This watch is much better than all those. It has great battery life for WearOS with a Snapdragon Wear 4100. I can usually get 2+ days out of it, but it also charges very fast. It uses the same charging cable as an E3 if you're upgrading (which is a big help for me, as now I have two cables). The response is fluid and quick, much faster than my previous ones, which is a big deal for me too. The ""Essential Mode"" change with this watch is very cool too. Now, when the watch is idle and ""always on screen"" is NOT enabled, it shows a watch display that turns off everything but the numbers and info and allows the reflective parts of the screen to provide extra detail. Very readable outside and in when in bright light, and better than a full color screen for that as well. Finally, it has a number of downloadable watch faces for free and paid, and the speaker/mic on the device works well for an impromptu call. Highly recommended!"
Camilo Valencia,"Overall, this is a great watch. I have teeeeeenny hands and while it’s really large for me, it’s also really comfortable and the weight of it feels good on my wrist. I have found it remarkably easy to get used to. The features work really well and the functions are easy to understand. It’s the most like a phone interface of any WearOS watch I’ve worn and I’ve worn a bunch. The display is stunning. It’s crystal clear, full color and actually easy to read longer blocks of text on. I’ve found the tracking effective and the functions all smooth. The battery life is decent - especially if you’re willing to turn off the fancy stuff. Not wanting to do that, I found myself charging it once every 3.5 days - but it charges quickly so a daily charge while you’re in the shower/getting dressed should do it. My only complaint isn’t actually about the watch, but rather that WearOS and Apple refuse to play nicely with each other. I want to be able to respond to texts on the watch because it’s so pleasing to read texts… but that’s not possible. Overall, it’s a really solid, good looking watch that does all of the things you want a smart watch to do.  I’d skip it if you’re an iPhone user but if you have an Android, you won’t be disappointed."
Jason,"I really wanted to like the watch but after just one day of connection issues and needless setup steps and I'm throwing in the towel. I'm not sure if it's the watch I got or in general but this seems like hours of set up for a mediocre experience.Every single mobvoi app needs to be opened on the watch and ran through to allow tracking. Often times these turn back off automatically.You CANNOT sync with Google fit. Third party data sharing is unauthorized for this watch at this time with no word on status from the company just that they are ""working on it"". Meanwhile every other wearos 3 compatible watch works just fine.Watch features seem to half work. Essential mode wouldn't stay on and the watch wouldn't aknowledge passed the set up prompts.I'm just going to stick with Amazfit BIP. Honestly, no one uses half the stuff current day smart watches provide and most fitness oriented watches suck at what they do."
Jason,"This is the third TicWatch I have owned and by far the best. I have also owned a Samsung and Fossil watch and this one outshines both of them. I use the watch for two basic functions, as a fitness & health tracker as well as a tool  which allows me to leave my phone in my pocket. It excels in both areas.I have the watch synced to both Google Fit and MyFitnessPal apps and it automatically populates both so I can keep track of my steps and calories burned for the day. I also love being able to see my heart rate and oxygen trends throughout the day.From a communication standpoint, I get my Teams messages, texts and notifications all in one place and I can even access Outlook to read and reply to email. It won't open attachments unfortunately, but I guess most of them would be hard to read on a watch anyway.  I can also receive or make calls from the watch and the sound quality on both ends is more than acceptable. I also love the fact that I can download music right from Spotify and  listen while on a walk/run without having to bring my phone along with me.I charge the battery every other day in 'always on mode' and I use it a lot. I  could probably go three days between charges but I want to make sure I don't run out of battery on the third day.I don't  use essential mode  as I  need  all the functionality that is lost in that mode. The only only thing I didn't like about the watch was the strap. Not a fan of the rubber look and feel of the strap and easily replaced it with a leather one, thanks to the quick release function.Overall, I would recommend this watch for anyone looking for a well featured watch with great battery life. There is not a better watch out there in my opinion."
Jerson M. Castro,"I want to love this watch. I think it looks great. I was interested in all the different exercises on it that can be tracked, the main one being the running gps and pace tracker. They both kinda suck. The pace by tracker for sure needs updating because when I was walking casually, the watch said I was going 15mph and during my runs it said I was going 7min mile pace which I know I wasn't doing. The distance tracker is alright, it tracks more than your actual distance, sometimes by .10mi and I know this since I compared it with other running apps and an apple watch. Pedometer is interesting, I don't think it really tracks steps, instead it tracks what feels like a step. I sit at work all day and move my arms often so I think it tracks those movements as steps.The Mobvoi app needs updating as well. I find myself just using Google fit instead which I don't want to? If TicWatch has it's own app if prefer to use that.The battery life is good. I charge it every time I shower. It's never gotten below 50% after an entire day use with 24hr tracking.Sleep tracker is absolute garbage. Nothing more to say about that.Watch has no indoor treadmill tracker, which is where I find myself using Google fit, but has a way to track you doing archery...I feel like returning this watch and spending more money on a Garmin."
Jerson M. Castro,"Got this Pro 3 Ultra to replace an older E3 Ticwatch. The face is slightly thicker, but after a few hours I figured out how much it stuck up off my wrist and stopped catching it on everything. Despite the abuse, the screen and body showed no wear. Speaking of the screen, it is much crisper and the colors are much brighter than the E3. The other big improvement is the battery life. On the E3 a full 12 hour day of wearing (with moderate use) would bring the battery down to sub 20%. The Pro 3 Ultra has been on my wrist for 22 hours straight several times and each time the battery was still above 70%.Over all this watch is a good, solid improvement on earlier models, while still retaining the simplicity of Wear OS. This watch makes a good upgrade to an older Ticwatch or as a good introduction to a Movbi product."
Kindle Customer,"I have been a TicWatch user since the first generation. I've had the TicWatch E, GTH, E3, and now the Pro 3 Ultra. The watches keep getting better and better. The Pro 3 Ultra has a great screen. Everything is easy to read and nice and crisp.  The battery life is great! It lasts about 4 days on one charge. I don't like wear my watch when sleeping, so I can't say how the sleep tracker is.  I hope they will update to the new Wear OS 3 or 3.5 soon."
Nick,I love the watch design and the two buttons.  The watch band is good quality and fits well.  It does everything I want it to and it is quick to respond.  The operating system and the Dual layers display to save battery life are the best part of the watch. All notifications come over clear and you can read everything easily.  The tracking is accurate. It works well with google fit but also has Mobvoi fitness apps. The battery life is better than any smartwatch I have tried. 3-4 days battery life with all of the tracking turned on.  Phone calls through the watch are better than expected with the audio sounding clear.
Nick,"I purchased this watch and have been using it for about a week. Overall, I am extremely impressed. I had a chance to see a GW4 in use, and the battery life was not worth it. After some searching, I decided upon the TW3 Ultra GPS. There are only a couple of nitpicks. The sleep tracking has been sporadic and seem to work about half the time. I did find that setting non-tracking hours seemed to help. Also, the Mobvoi app needs work. On the plus side, the display is great, and the dual display is a feature I didn't know I needed. I find I'm using it most often as I'm driving just to look at the time. The Wear OS watch face options seem limited unless you utilize Facer or another similar app. The Samsung Galaxy Store did appear more robust with its watch face selection. The big reason I bought this watch though was for the battery. Even with all features turned on, I still average 4- 5 days of use between charges. I have found that even when the battery is extremely low, the essential mode still allows for the basic watch functions. Despite the few issues I mentioned above (and, honestly, what technology doesn't have some issue?), I still give this watch 5 stars as it definitely has exceeded my expectations for a smartwatch that wasn't Samsung or Apple. My GW3 still works after three years, and I didn't feel the GW4 was a step up. Hopefully, the TicWatch performs as long or longer...."
Frederick F. Kantz,"This is a great watch.The size of the watch is one of the best, sleek looking, and very functional. The dual screens do make a difference when it comes to battery life and the ease of being able to look at time, steps, and basic necessities. The design is a little more rugged then older Ticwatches but looks awesome. When I switched to a magnetic band it made the watch look a lot better as well. The ease of setting everything up was great and being able to use NFC without pulling out my phone make life a lot easier. I would have liked the dial to be able to move and control the watch but does not deter from the watch. I would have also liked to have wireless charging but again doesn't take away from the watch. This also has been awesome for working out and tracking heart rate within the Ticwatch and Google apps. Will definitely stick with Ticwatch in the future."
Ekimnosneb,"This watch is totally perfect for the buck!All features worked perfectly and the battery lasts for more than 2 weeks because of the low power essential mode screen. Workout stats are also very accurate and I didn't have any issue using any of the workout modes. Sleep tracking is extremely useful along with the SpO2 tracking, which helps me manage my sleep better. Moreover, the weight is also not that much and I find it easier to exercise with as compared to some of the other smartwatch brands I own. All in all, it's a great buy for the price! Definitely recommend"
Frogroast,"In general, the watch works fairly well. It can Call, Text, and Tap to Pay perfectly. However, the Reminder app that is permanently installed does not function at all. I downloaded 'My Fitness Pal' App to calorie count and the voice to text option does not work. There seems to be an issue with the voice functionality as even google assistant is unable to set reminders or perform other various tasks. Also, many intuitive options are completely missing from this watch. You cannot remove or even hide numerous apps that are preloaded onto the watch. This makes the app screen permanently clutter with useless apps. Small QOL options like making alarms that are set from your phone to be silent on the watch are blatantly missing. So every morning my alarm for work also goes off on my watch with an unchangeable sound that I cannot switch off, which is unfortunate and completely fixable with a decent software update.  The watch has good bones and a great look, but it is Not Fully Functional in its current state. With a 200+ price point I would definitely recommend researching other options before buying."
superbrain,"I've been using smartwatches for almost 10 years, starting out with the original Pebble watch.In all this time, I've had several smartwatches I've loved, but this one takes the cake as the best smartwatch I've had so far.At first, I was concerned with how big the watch would look on my wrist. I have fairly small ones, but it does look nice even though it's probably the biggest watch I've had.The battery lasts much longer than other Wear OS watches I've had.I charged it on Friday afternoon, went on a weekend trip without my charger (which felt weird, since it's the first time I've been able to do that in a while), and still had enough juice when I got home.During that trip I also went swimming, watch and all, to see how waterproof it'd be. The watch performed quite well during the test.I must say I'm not particularly focused on fitness, so I can't say much about that side of it. I've been tracking my heartrate and it feels accurate, but I can't say much more about that.Another thing I'd like to add that feels great is the secondary display. It kinda reminds me of my Pebble times with the screen,, but it's nice to have that's packed with more features. I love an always-on display, and knowing this one works without draining the battery is wonderful. Plus, I love being able to customise the colour of the screen when it lights up.Talking about displays, I love the one on this one. The screen feels crisp and is very nice to look at.Overall, I've had the watch for about a little over a week now and I'm very impressed with it.Only thing I'd change about it would be having rotating crowns that scroll, but that's about it. I'd totally recommend it to anyone looking for a new WearOS watch."
EriqX,"This watch is totally bang for the buck!All features worked perfectly and the battery lasts for more than 2 weeks because of the low power essential mode screen. Workout stats are also very accurate and I didn't have any issue using any of the workout modes. Sleep tracking is extremely useful along with the SpO2 tracking, which helps me manage my sleep better. Moreover, the weight is also not that much and I find it easier to exercise with as compared to some of the other smartwatch brands I own. All in all, it's a great buy for the price! Definitely recommended for someone in budget."
EriqX,I have been using Ticwatch from couple of years. Looking at the latest version it is definite the watch has improved a lot compared to it's predecessors. The look and feel of this watch is premium and the software is quite smooth. The different exercises which has been introduced is what I liked the most. Sleep tracking is good but needs more improvement. Since the watch is big I am not that confident to sleep wearing it. I would definitely recommend to give this watch a try.
nick palmitessa,"This is a really greta smart watch. The battery life us the best, 3 full days of battery, everyday I do one hour walk around the neighborhood and I go bouldering in the evenings, so basically 3 hrs of training every day and I track it with the TicExercie app in the watch, and still lasts for 3 days.I don't use all the features or sensors it has, only gps, step counter, heart rate while exercising and sleep tracking. I know it has a bunch of other stuff but for me what I use it for is more than enough.I like the dual display, having the liquid crystal display definitely saves battery, it is limited to show only date/time and steps normally, and shows a little bit more of info when training (heart rate, calories, duration, maybe distance, depends on the exercise), but there is no costumization on that screen. The only thing you can costumize for that screen is the color it flashes when you turn your wrist. The back light is great to see ut at night without actually turning the oled display, that us great. The color tho, I played with all the colors but all seemed too bright, so I just left the default which is good enough to not burn my eyes in the middle of the night.I changed the strap to a different one, the one it comes with is good but I cant stand the silicone ones, they make me sweat, personal preference, and there are a bunch of cheap straps in here.Performance wise, the watch is great, responsive at all times, even low battery, very fast, Bluetooth connection to the phone is always on point (on other older watches I had trouble keeping it connected and intermittently loosing connection, tic watches).10/10 for me, you got me at 3 days battery life."
nick palmitessa,"I have been buying tic watches since they were croudfunded. The ability to stay relevant in such a cloudy market speaks volumes for them.This watch is absolutely beautiful, it's sleek and unassuming yet powerful and bold. So far the battery has been excellent, notifications vibrate enough that I haven't gotten used to it yet as I do with all my other smart watches. So happy that Mobvoi stuck with WearOS as I enjoy the native functionality with Mt android phone.The watch feels great to wear, the band is comfortable and soft. The watch itself is sleek yet big enough for my big self..I am still testing all the features but so far everything works as advertised, gps is accurate and the heart rate monitor matches that of my blood pressure monitor. Very pleased with this purchase and will be buying a few more for Xmas presents."
Nicholas,"I have had several smartwatches and so far the ticwatch pro 3 ultra GPS has been the best, in both responsiveness, sports tracking, healthcare. In an normal day with 100% I can use the watch for almost 3 days. I love the dual display mode. As soon as I get into my treadmill and start walking the Ticwatch pro 3 detects it and during the exercise  period informs me on distance and steps. The smartwatch is gorgeous, display is great and responsive. It is really snappy to handle. Being the OS Wear OS gives me access to the great catalog of apps for Wear OS in the Play Store.  I am very happy. Thank you Mobvoi for an excellent product."
Nicholas,"I loved the big display.  Nice smart watch.  Sleep tracking wasn't too good.  Decent for the price,"
Ryan Burket,"So to get the most out of this watch, they want you to install the Mobvoi app. That's fine. But after doing so, I wasn't able to get log in or register. I kept getting ""network error"". So I went to my PC to see if I could sort it out there. Also unable to register or log in. I thought that was peculiar and decided to give a bit as maybe they were having some technical issues.So an hour later I try again - no luck. Then it dawns on me... I'm blocking all traffic to and from China on my firewall. Once I bypassed that everything worked fine.All that to say, the Mobvoi app(s) is sending data to China. If you're cool with that, it's a great watch. Has a nice weight to it, perfect size, awesome screen."
Ryan Burket,"Love the watch, everything works as advertised. Just wish the battery life was longer."
Amanda Fisk,"I simply got tired of waiting for the new Pixel Watch.  After now seeing that rendering I am super happy I went with the Ultra Pro 3.  It definitely looks more rugged and not a single scratch after banging it around many times.There are numerous reasons I bought this watch, one of the best features I use daily is non contact NFC Google Pay at the market.  I find all the other features useful as well.  Sleep tracking, heart monitor, GPS with workout route taken map.I have never run out of battery life using full feature no battery conserve.  I did buy an awesome charger stand for it. (Soarking Replacement Connection Charging Dock Compatible with TicWatch Pro 3 Charger Stand Station Case Friendly with 5 Feet Cable Black).I don't use any of the provided watch faces as I use the Facer App for that entertainment and superb custom faces.The phone call feature works seamlessly and has very clear sound on both ends.  Paired great with my new Pixel 6.I waited for it to go on sale and paid $255.00 which I think is a great deal for this highly featured watch.I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it over all other Wear OS watches.Also,  the Google Assistant is awesome too.Looking forward to the Wear OS 3 update this fall."
Amanda Fisk,"The watch is a step above the Android Wear watches I’ve tried before. The watch works super smooth performance wise and doesn’t lag like some older models.Build quality is excellent, the buttons have a very satisfying click and the materials feel appropriate. One of my favorite things is the dual mode display, turning into a regular digital watch when not in use and saving on battery. Realistically I saw 2.5 days of usable battery life. Workout tracking was also decent although I couldn’t test the sleep tracking as I don’t like to wear a watch when I sleep.The only downside in my case is that the cable is regular USB rather than Type-C like all my other devices."
Maxwell,"For the most part, the watch works as noted.  Battery life is reduced significantly if you use the always on screen.  If you turn that feature off, it uses a digital tone on tone screen, so you can see the time, but sometimes notifications don't pop up like they should.  Seems decent enough, maybe a tad bit overpriced for a knock off."
Domenic Nocera,"I returned this watch because the heart rate monitor was off by about 20 beats per minute.  I dropped this off at an Amazon location in UCI Irvine plaza.  It's been 3 weeks now and status shows my return has not been received therefore no refund yet.  I recommend not buying this watch and definitely not from this store.  If I had known I was not going to get my $280 back I would have just kept the watch....UPDATE...coincidentally I received my refund exactly 1 day after submitting my review.  So I increased the number of stars but can't give 5 because  I was stressed for about 2 weeks not seeing a refund.  The watch is nice, it just needs work on HRM feature....Their customer service personally reached out to me to try to resolve any issues...made me feel like they stand behind their products...I'm going from 1 star...to 3 stars...and now to 5 stars.  Product support and backing is very important to me."
Danny Hurtado,"I like this watch for a lot of reasons, but really my favorite thing about it is the battery life.  I know TicWatch is not the only company that does this, but the low power mode will keep it going for days (I think supposedly up to a month) in a passive, e-ink watch form.  Even with normal use it has lasted two days for me.It also does all the usual smart fitness watch things like tracking your steps, activities (WatchOS may have its problems but unless you use an apple watch,  you are stuck with it), sleep, heartrate, oxygen, etc.  I mostly use it running where it seems to track fine both indoors and outdoors.  I've used it swimming a couple times but only in a smaller pool... haven't tested it in an olympic size pool yet and I'm actually a bit leery about exposing it to the ocean even though it is supposed to be fine.It looks good and the watch band hasn't gotten smelly after daily use.I had a problem with the watch early on where it froze, but the manufacturer replaced the watch immediately which I appreciate.  I also received a new watch, not a refurbished one thankfully.Visibility on this watch is better than the last TicWatch model I had, meaning I can see in direct sunlight without a problem.Biggest downside for me is that the charger is not compatible with the last TicWatch I had and it's not wireless charging."
Ethan Pearson-Pomerantz,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Got a watch.  I have been using watches from this manufacturer for a long time (at first there were Ticwatch Pro, then for about 5 years Ticwatch Pro 4g / LTE) and now I decided to buy myself on the occasion of Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS.  If anyone has doubts, I recommend.  They look great, comfortable to use and which is especially convenient the backlight of the second screen.  I have always missed her.  Speed, workmanship, appearance, the ability to make payments through GPay and all this right away.  I could try to look for the LTE version, but it's possible in the future if I decide.  For this money you can't find better watch.  Again, I used the previous model for several years and had no problems.  I recommend to buy."
customer,"Ok. I'm gonna make this quick.I'm not one to waffle.The good:StrongLooks greatFast chargeThe bad:Sometimes laggySometimes ears it's batteryLess than a year in, buttons becoming....less responsiveThe ugly:TrackingI bought this watch primarily for the tracking functions.The sleep function 👌SpO2: eh... It works sometimes...Stress tracker: Why botherAll that said, I love this watch even with it's shortcomings.I'm going to try a full reset/flush and see if that takes care of some of the issues I'm having.Will be back with update if things change"
Frogroast,"I have had a few different Ticwatches, but this one is by far my favorite. I think my favorite upgrades are the always on feature that looks almost like a white ink display and the extended battery life. I am able to get nearly twice as much usage of of my watch because I don't have to fully wake the device to check the time or battery life. These functions in the battery saving always on screen are literally a game changer. One other big upgrade is the fact that the watch is mainly made of metal vs plastic which makes the device feel much more premium. I'm definitely going to be using this watch as my daily driver."
superbrain,"The last few weeks the battery would die within a few hours.  Then a black screen with all sorts of letters and numbers was all over it.  Wont charge anymore.  I liked it when it worked, but wouldn't purchase again."
Lindsay ,"The Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS has good build quality and nice style.  The display is bright and clear even on the sunniest days.  The band is stiff but comfortable keeping the watch on the wrist. Battery life exceeded expectation lasting more than three days away from the charger.  The watch is always responsive and runs apps without hesitation. Now lets add cellular to this watch to make it truly independent, which it can do.  We won't mention the dated Wear OS.  Great watch with great fit, finish and style."
Lindsay ,"First off this has great battery life a full 3-days on a charge. The dual screens are a good idea and a great battery saver, giving you a readable time and date and battery life at all times. Unlike the last generation no notifications for calls or apps have been missed. It runs on where OS so there are more apps out there if you so desire. The touch controls and screen response are snappy and quick as well as the buttons. The only con I would give is for the Mobvoi app. There's not much to it and what is there is not very intuitive. The watch was able to pair with three different Android phones with three different versions of the Android OS. Overall it's a good choice if you don't want to be chained to a certain brand of phone."
Jim Davis,"Bought this because i liked the idea of having a battery that could last with modern health tracking features. However I was extremely let down.- Battery (Terrible)I went to sleep with 85% battery. slept for 9 hours and it was at 4 percent in the morning. I had it set to theater mode to keep the backlit screen from turning on, since disabling raise to wake doesn't prevent the backlit LCD from lighting up. Essentially the entire battery usage was solely from it monitoring my heart rate it seems. For reference my 2 year old Huawei Watch GT uses about 2-3% battery while I sleep and lasts about 10 days with continuous heart rate monitoring.- Sleep TrackingI slept 9 hours last night with both my Huawei Watch GT an the Ticwatch on. Huawei measured the full nights sleep, while the ticwatch measured only 2.5 hours of sleep.- Heart RateHowever Heart Rate monitoring is displayed in intervals showing the highest rate and the lowest rate in a set period of time through the mobvoi app on my phone. whereas my old watch GT would display a graph of the entire day. I couldn't find a way to see a graph of the entire day, which i prefer. I found HR monitoring to be almost useless for the way i like my information displayed.- Health FeaturesI partially got the Ticwatch because I read it will monitor spo2, and heartrate 24 hours. mosty I wanted to see my spo2 levels when sleeping (to find out if i possibly have sleep apnea). However with 24 hour monitoring enabled in the watch for all of it' different features (stress, spo2, heart rate, fatigue/energy) The only thing it would 24 hour monitor was the heart rate. I hadto go in and do manual tests for it's other features.OverallWell 36 hours into ownership I am sending it back. I watched videos and read a bunch of information on what it was supposed to do prior to buying it. And I was solely let down. 10 hours of battery life makes this useless to me, and the health features didn't seem to work the way I read they should. Perhaps I rea the wrong information and perhaps i didn't test it long enough. Either way, even if I could get all the 24 hour monitoring to work as I read, with 10 hours battery life (with 24 hour monitoring on) and about an hour and half to charge. It's not a viable option, at least for me."
B,"This is my third TicWatch and most definitely the best so far.Initial set up on the iPhone was not without issues, I had to reset and restart the install several times. However, once set up, it has been rock solid and reliable since."
Janki,"The app says it is connected to the watch but also shows no battery life even when the watch is 100% charged.  because of this, the synch between the two does not happen.  The features on the watch are really informative.  Look on the internet for a manual.  Nothing in the box. Not the most intuitive to set up. When all features are active the battery life seems to be just 8 hours.  I want the features and a watch, not a watch with features that I can use."
Harrison,"Very often when I try to reconnect it before I go to work it doesn't connect and I have to restart the watch, then it Often thinks I'm running or doing sum else and would incorrectly track my activities, it also dies too quickly even if I disabled the background tracking data it feels like it shouldn't be as low as it is its a nice watch but it really as it's downsides"
carlos romero,"This is it, Android user, this is the watch you need - if you are looking for the Apple Watch answer. This watch has the looks to beat the Apple watch and the features to beat any other Android watch I have tested. Outside of the Samsung watches, which are just that - Samsung bloatware watches; you will be hard pressed to find a more robust featured watch with such a strong battery life.Sport enthusiasts will love the accurate heart rate tracking, SPO2 tracking, stress level tracking, and workout modes. All far more accurate than some of the cheaper watches I have used in the past like Mi Band and Amazfit.Techno junkies will love being able to both read and full reply to messages from their wrist, take crystal clear calls from their wrist, and have music readily available to Bluetooth devices from the onboard storage.Minimalists will love the dual screen mode which lets this watch go for days without a charge while ALWAYS showing the time, date, steps, AND seconds - before it jumps to the full beautiful screen with notifications. (GREAT for those working in fields where time is important - first responders/nurses take note, this thing can take a beating and help out with ABCs). It can also have schedules in place to save battery even more with reducing the amount of sensors used, and if the are on, when they are used.If this watch is current state of Mobvoi, I am VERY excited for the future. This watch is legit."
carlos romero,"I have used the TicWatch pro 3 Ultra for a few days and here are my findings:+ Fast+ Ok Screen+ Fast integration with Android Wear [Not with google fit]+- Battery life is ok but not as I expected. Only if you dont work out, dont receive notifications, turn off location and wifi, then you can get more than 2 days. I did not try essential mode because in my opinion, that should be used in specific situations [Go travel, camping, running out of battery and no near charger]+- I wanted an Android Wear watch to easily sync with Google Fit. I noticed that the sinc is slow and needs to give full access or remove any battery restriction to both mobvoi, and google fit apps.- This watch looks like a toy compared with Fossil and Galaxy Watch4 and the Watch4 Classic.- The Mobvoi app is use less and after 3 days of use, the app stayed refreshing for ever. I couldnt use even clearing cache.- I found myself touching the wrong app while navigating the watch display due to missing the rotating bezel or crown.For the price of $299, I could easily recommend a Samsung Galaxy Watch4 or the classic because of the new integration with Android Wear, it looks premium, the screen is brighter and more colorful, and battery life is similar or better. Just wait for blackfriday or a big discount and you will be glad."
Swapnil,"Por su potencia y duración de batería, solo lo compararía con el Samsung W 5. Sin embargo, el precio es bastante inferior al de ese equipo."

Amit,"I bought this watch a year ago with the one deciding factor that it would get Wear OS 3. But Mobvoi has decided to both not provide an update and not inform it's customer base as to when it is coming. Now that I am seeing lower battery life, an update to improve performance would be a much needed upgrade, but of course nothing from Mobvoi. (The last promise was end of year 2022)I have seen this before with other manufacturers. A promise that never happens. My thought is we will see a Ticwatch Pro 4, and maybe one half working update on the 3 before it gets discontinued, that is if we are lucky.I moved on. My Ticwatch is back in the box and my everyday is a $40 band that gives me 14 days of battery life. I may upgrade to this companies non wear os GTS model as this $40 band has been flawless.But no more Mobvoi, never again."
Lydia,"There's plenty of YouTube reviews on this watch so I won't repeat all that stuff you can find online. I got this because of the 3 day battery life and performance. What I was most concerned about was the size, feel on my wrist and look. I came from a fossil gen 5 and felt that perfectly met my expectations on those 3 things but failed miserably in battery life and performance. I'm happy to say the ultra looks pretty good. My wife actually prefers the look of the ultra over the gen5 fossil. Looks more masculine if that's your thing. I like the style of the ultra better than the older pro 3. Looks much more refined. The strap is a throwaway though and it doesn't fit with the aesthetic of the watch at all IMO. I went through and found the 3 I think looks good on the watch for different occasions. The watch is big and thick but no bigger than I expected. It's taking some getting use to adjusting from the gen 5 since it was so small. The size reminds me of those chunky deisil watches but not nearly as heavy. All that being said the watch is shockingly comfortable on the wrist. The gen 5s biggest flaw IMO was that center dial that kept poking my hand and would turn the watch on by accident or call Google. Even though this watch is bigger it's more comfortable than the fossil gen5 due to the button placement. I guess my ONLY disappointed is the plastic finish. Looks a little cheap to me. I would have paid a little more for an all metal body."
Lydia,"It's been year or so since I've purchased my TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra.  Definitely a beautiful watch.  Everything was exactly as described.  I didn't have problems with the watch until after surfing with it.  The watch would all of sudden freeze up where swiping the screen or pressing the side dials would not work.  There have been times where I would have to do a hard reset, let the battery drain or plug to the charge overnight just to get it to function again.  It came to the point where I chose not to get the watch wet at all.  Unfortunately, I forgot to take my watch off during one of my recent surf session and that was it.  It's now just décor on the desk.  Don't get me wrong...I think it's a great watch.  Would I buy another...""I was hoping that water sports would be the last thing to worry about."""
mprime34,"My first ever smartwatch! Did a ton of watch research and landed on this as my pick, and love it. Needed something that had GPS, but was also good at being a smartwatch, could track my workouts, and was rugged enough to handle the field work of a wildlife biologist. I'm currently working with turtles and routinely am in VERY muddy chest-deep water (watch rated to around 5 feet) getting gross, and this watch has handled it every day for the last month or so, and cleans up like a champ, as good as new. On top of that, it's one of the few watches in line to get the next OS upgrade. I LOVE the low-energy clock (""essential mode"") screen I have on all the time. It looks super clean and sharp, and the battery life is fantastic. So happy I can trust a nice smartwatch to handle my biology fieldwork! Only thing that may improve it for me would be an even higher waterproof rating, and the ability to run the OnX app (shows land ownership with GPS tracking). Great watch!"
Frogroast,"This is my second mobvoi watch. I still believe they are the best Android Watch on the market.  The battery life is incredible. I love the back and grey screen to conserve battery when not is use. The fitness tracking is very accurate.  It has oxygen sensor, sleep tracking, Google pay etc. If I had to pick one thing I don't like is I wish I could add cellular service so I could add it to my T-Mobile plan. Besides that is is perfect and I have had Samsung watches and apple watches."
superbrain,"I am an android user, so I've had been looking into Ticwatch, Samsung, Fitbit, Garmen, etc. But landed on Ticwatch Pro Ultra and I bought it to get a better read on my heart health as well as my walking activity.And I've found that the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS Smartwatch has been pretty accurate, and with the battery life being pretty good, several days with the 24 hour heart monitoring.I've used Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and other Fitbit watches, but wanted the Heart rate monitoring. My past experiences with smartwatches is that they tend to last about 1 day and then you'd have to charge it up.  But with this Ticwatch I've gone through the weekend without having to charge and with still some battery life to spare while the 24 heart rate monitoring is going on.I'm not much of a user of the sleep monitoring, but some of the Tic Apps installed on the watch are pretty useful, and seamlessly connected.Additionally, I've used the watch when receiving a call, and my hands aren't free, and the microphone and speaker did pretty good such that I've been able to have quick conversations while in the market.  Also the notification features are great, and when I get texts or Google hangout messages, it pretty easy to reply.I've been using the watch for about 3 weeks, and its been great."
Raymundo Garcia,"Just another boring smartwatch. Nothing special except battery life is slightly better than average. Everythibg else is the same. I'm done trying to find ""the perfect smartwatch."" So massive, it's like wearing a frying pan (sans handle) on your wrist."
Raymundo Garcia,"Main thing for me was the larger battery. It definitely more than fits my needs, wearing all day and charging overnight. Pretty quick to top off on those mornings after which I chose to wear it to bed. On top of that, a larger and brighter display than what I had previously tried (Fossil Gen 6), and a, so far, very durable case. Compatible with standard 22mm bands. The band that came with it is very nice—soft, with just enough give. I'm not really into a two-piece ""belt-buckle-style"" band anyway, but I wasn't able to adjust it to the exact right fit for ME, which REQUIRES it to stay in place to keep some of the sensors from seeing my tattoo and getting disrupted, e.g., suddenly thinking it's off-wrist and locking the screen (see pictures). The off-wrist calibration feature is your friend ;) Anyway, yada, yada, yada, YMMV. Sleep tracking works, but could be a bit more accurate as far as wake time, which is probably comparable with typical smartwatches. Regarding heart rate accuracy, it seems fairly on point, but sometimes—well, oftentimes—when my HR is high, it will first register at about half, then jumps up to a more believable reading. You might find better accuracy with a dedicated fitness tracker, but for a smartwatch, I'm happy. Recommended! **Pictured watch face (ambient mode), ""I-Digit"" by Thema; pictured band, Fullmosa 22mm Black Stainless Steel (see my review)."
Mike,This was an upgrade for me from the original Ticwatch Pro.  Not a huge fan.  Charging can be temperamental and battery life over time has really been a downer.  I get a full day but in the beginning I was getting almost 3 days.  6 months later I am not nearly as happy.  I will look elsewhere in the future.
fynflood,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I've been looking for a smartwatch for a while and picked this one up during prime day.I usually over research everything I buy, especially electronics. This one was strange. I found majority of reviews whether YouTube or Google to be in favor of this watch. Not much negativity at all. So I decided to get it.Once I opened the package I was very happy with look and feel. Once I got it going I had some notifications come through. That's when I noticed the vibration is so loud it's like they're is something wrong with it. I then googled the noise and found there are a lot of people on forums that have the exact issue. I mean it is basically unusable if you are in a quite environment. There is no way to disable it, which I find strange. I also attached a video to this review to explain what I mean.Too bad, I really wanted to like this watch but it will be getting returned. It's a noise you'd expect from a $30 smartwatch."
Doug,"So I upgraded feom the Ticwatch Pro 3 GPS and although it's very similar in specs the changes that were made I found made the switch worth it. Love the ability to have the led color option for the ""SLEEP"" screen which makes it more visible during day time. Also the display even though the same specs to me appears more vibrant and brighter. The new case feels better on the wrist and I like the flush mount glass. The band is better as well and even though petty I love that they added another notch at the end to keep it from catching on things. Battery life for me I've gone 3 days full use with out having to charge it- but I don't use always on display. I've had this watch for just about 2 weeks now and love it. I have the Mobvoi Tic pods ANC and they pair flawlessly with it.I guess if I had to say something negative about it is the charging system ....would like to see wireless charging. As well as would like to see a Wear OS upgrade to OS 3.I'm an android guy and Mobvoi ticwatch is my go to daily watch."
Jimmy James,"The TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS has been nothing but fantastic! The setup and was easy and fast. Mobvoi's dual processor system gives the watch boost in speed and battery life that goes perfectly with the benefits of the snapdragon 4100. There isn't any lagging, and it legitimately feels like my watch flies through any request I give it. I think the best feature of the watch is the battery life it can easily go 3 full days until It needs to be recharged. I love the fact that you can answer calls on the watch! The sound quality is really good. The Mobvoi app is simple straightforward, and easy to use. Depending on the level of formality or even just the mood I am in for the day, I can change the watch faces, (with +1000 to choose from is easy) to reflect the occasion. Since most of my time is spent outside, the option to customize the backlight for the dual display works perfectly with my day-to-day routine (which by the way is awesome). Even the workout modes are easy to use and work perfectly. I have tried tennis, cycling, beach volleyball, running, bouldering and gym exercises among others, and they accurately report said activity feedback example: calories burned, cardiac rhythms etc. As for swimming, I have nothing to worry about because of the watch IP68 rating."
Jimmy James,"I purchased this in January of 2022 based upon the promise that Wear OS3 would be provided in 2022.  It is 2023, and the company has ghosted everyone asking about this upgrade, and the lack of security updates since September 2022.The company will promise what you want to hear, advertise it, and once they have your money, stop all support.Furthermore, there is a bug that has existed for 4 months that drains the battery in less than a day if you enable GPS.  The company wants you to disable GPS, making the watch somewhat useless for those who wish  to use it for fitness tracking.  They blame the bug on Google, but again, refuse to upgrade to Wear OS3 which would resolve it.Lastly, because Wear OS2 is now obsolete, many apps have migrated away from it, greatly reducing those that can & will work with the Ticwatch device(s).Save your money, and buy something that is made by an honorable and reputable company."
Birapar Singh,"I really wanted to like this watch. Great screen, adequate battery life, lots of features. The killer was the Bluetooth connection. Very erratic. Sometimes it would work for a day, or an hour or I even had to delete the app and reinstall it. This was a showstopper for me. I sent it back. I assume that all the excellent reviews are based on using this watch with a different smartphone. Just not for me."
Birapar Singh,A couple weeks in everything seems to work as it should. I keep most the sensors on and it'll still last a day and a half which I like. My biggest complaint is the step counting. It seems to be very inaccurate and has way more steps than I actually acquire during the day. At work. I counted my steps across our warehouse at 47 and it gave me almost 150 steps for them. The GPS tracking has worked very well when I have been out hiking though.
Chuck W,"I have previously owned the Ticwatch E (gen 1) and the Ticwatch C2, and this device has many features that those devices didn't have.Pros:1. The Pro 3 supports 24/7 heart rate tracking through Google Fit, a welcome addition that previous generations didn't have.2. I've found the processing speed to be overall much faster; before, I could barely use the Google Assistant due to slow processing, but with the Pro 3 the OS feels much snappier.3. The C2 did not have a speaker which I didn't think made much sense, given that one of the most obvious use cases of a smartwatch is the ability to pick up calls. I am glad the microphone was reintroduced to the Pro 3.4. Though I haven't tried the feature yet, I think swim tracking will prove to be a great addition to the device.5. As of now, the update has not been released, but I'm looking forward to receiving support for WearOS 3 sometime soon.6. The low-energy display feature is a cool gimmick, but I haven't seemed to have needed it since the battery is able to last all day anyways, even with Always On Display enabled.Cons:1. While overall the Pro 3 is much better, I did prefer the design and smaller footprint of the C2.2. While not important, I would have liked to see this device have wireless charging capabilities."
lee,"This is the third smartwatch from Mobvoi that I have purchased, and so far this has been my favorite.  One of the first improvements is the ability to change the backlight color, which is great because the white is no longer incredibly bright in a dark room, and makes it easier on the eyes.  Secondly, the ability to schedule ""essential mode"" is great, and good for those people that want to use it to avoid distractions while still keeping track of their steps while also allowing you to save battery.Battery life is good and so far on par with their 3 day claims, even when using many of the features of the watch.  While this can be extended using the ""essential mode"" I doubt I will use that mode very often because I use my watch to track my heart rate and look at notifications without having to look at my phone.The watch paired flawlessly with the phone, and the addition of BT 5.0 is nice, notifications are fast, sometimes alerting me before my message tone sounds on the phone.  Connection has been stable with no issues.Finally, the screen is nice and bright outside and I think this edges out earlier watches like the Ticwatch pro 3 in terms of crispness and touch.If your in the market for a new watch, give this serious consideration I don't think you'll be disappointed."
foxhenchman,"I'm 51 and very fit, so I bought it mostly for the Afib monitoring and sleep tracking.  Turning on the O2 monitor along with all the other sensors really drains the battery in 2 days.  Charging is fast but could be a bit faster.  My fastest charge from near zero power was close to two hours.Although the battery life with all sensors on is short, it is FAR better than others like the Galaxy with equivalent services turned on.  Mobvoi, please try to find a way to give additional options for the sensors in the software like maybe a ""lite mode"" that would check a little less frequently and consume less battery as a result.Overall I'm thrilled with the watch and would by the next version assuming the feature difference was enough and it as on sale, of course.  Go Mobvoi!!"
Vladymyr,"I recently upgraded to the Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra after having the original Ticwatch Pro 3 for roughly 18 months. After a ton of research, a ton of comparing, there is no better watch. The simple fact of the dual-screen is amazing. For the most part, I needed something I can look at to tell the time, work when I work out, and track my sleeping accurately. To be able to twist my wrist and for the screen to light up and not use the main software saves a ton of battery life and a ton of time. I wear this watch 24/7. It comes off to charge, and then goes back on, the comfort level is amazing, it does not feel like it's on my wrist half the time, I sometimes forget it's there when I am even about to shower. On the accuracy of o2 levels, sleeping, and working out, it is on par with Samsung and maybe even better in tracking some other things. All in all, this is the best watch I ever owned and will stay in the Mobvoi family."
Vladymyr,"Edit: I had trouble creating an online account for my watch/app. Registering an account to allow online access for the watch and app for data and updates requires entering in an emailed code to create an account. But you only get 60 seconds from when you click “get code” to receive it and type it in. I contacted support via email, and after several exchanges with them, I finally received a reset link that worked and I was able to complete the process. That was just a couple of days ago, and so far, the watch and app seem to be working fine."
Frogroast,"I love this watch! I believe you could drive a truck over it and it would be fine. The battery life was incredible. However, I don't usually like wearing watches. This was a bit bulky and surprisingly heavy. Only for that reason I returned it and got a Samsung Galaxy watch instead. I will say it was everything this Samsung watch is and more. Just a bit heavy and bulky. But if you want something that's going to last hiking, camping anything, trail running, swimming, mountain biking this is your watch!"
superbrain,"It meets all the reviews I've read about this being a great Wear OS watch.  Battery is as billed.  You do need t limit the amount of apps you have notifications going to it and turn off a few of the monitors to achieve the 2-3 day smartwatch battery life, but honestly I don't want several of those going anyway.  If you have used a Wear OS watch, you should have no issues using this one.  Went from a Fossil to this with zero learning curve.  Very pleased with purchase so far.  I would love another cellular watch available in the US from them."
A. Tomczak,Bought this watch after weeks for searching and comparing different wear OS watches. You get a good bang for your buck on this watch. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.
A. Tomczak,"Great watch, I have used others in the past from Mobvoi and they always are getting better! The battery has improved from the Ticwatch 3 and a lot better than the pixel watch. It's a little large but I have a big wrist so it's fine for me, may be too large for some. That would be my only negative thing to say of the watch."
Patrick Meijer,"The TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra looked great on paper and had a very affordable price. It also boasted that it could be updated to WearOS 3 in the future. It also promised terrific battery life.Coming from a Garmin Vivoactive 3, I was looking for a smartwatch with capable and accurate fitness tools. This watch was a huge step down from Garmin's strong fitness and exercise software. Perhaps that's asking too much from Mobvi but I found that the TicWatch let me down on the basics such as step counting, calories burned counting and GPS tracking.I was unable to find a watch face I liked that also displayed the correct and up to date count of steps and calories. Additionally, the Tic Watch  Pro 3 Ultra was cumbersome in linking with my Pixel 4a and Google Fit. I'm not new to Android tech. I had far too much trouble in setting the watch up. I had to go into online forums to find ways to get the watch and phone running concurrently. You shouldn't have to do that and the average user probably wouldn't.Although I did get the watch set up on my phone, accuracy was inconsistent at best. Compared to my Gain Vivoactive 3, steps and calories were way off. The watch also had trouble syncing with Fit as if there was some sort of a delay.Other smart watch features worked well enough. Being to able to take calls from the watch was a good experience. Controlling music from my phone was very useful. The watch ran well with few hiccups. Notifications were hit or miss as was the Google Assistant.I returned it shortly after purchasing. I was pretty disappointed. The battery life alone was a huge selling point. However the inconsistent software felt like the mobvi software was fighting assistant the Wear OS software. Too much of a hassle for the price I paid for ~$300."
Patrick Meijer,"This is my 3-rd attempt with smartwatches. First was Samsung 4 classic 42: nice, great features, WearOS-3, LTE (not working w/Xfinity) but 10 hours battery life. Returned. Second: Fossil gen. 6. Such a mistake. WearOS-2, less features just a few screen styles, same battery life.Tikwatch 3: I was worried about the size, since I prefer 42-44 mm with real watches. But this one is not as bulky as I thought. Sleek shape makes it look smaller. Real 3+ days on one charge, wow! OK software and features. Dual display rocks! I hate the empty black screen on other smartwatches when inactive. This one always shows time and other stuff. Old electronic watch style - sweet. I hope it will get Wear-3 in 2022 and get on par with Samsung in features and convenience."
Morrison Family!,"There's a lot to like about the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra as it has checked all of the boxes for a premium smartwatch.It can monitor heartrate, sleep tracking, step counts, blood oxygen levels and more. It links up to your Google account so you can get alerts from email, calendar and more.After you get past the obvious feature set of the TicWatch Pro, you start to see where the watch really drops off and comes up short. My main complaints are hardware and design and not so much the WearOS system running the watch.Here's what I did not like:1. The all plastic body is not considered to be in the ""Ultra"" catagory2. The included strap is cheap and thick3. The vibration motor is harsh and inconsistent in operation4. The charging clip is poorly designed and is easily knocked off5. Charging is very slow6. Battery life is not what they claim of 72 hours, I was getting half that7. The dual screen feature is of little value and got tiring8. Audio quality was flat and the microphone quality is awful9. The price is far too high. There are better watches for the same or less that have premium materials"
Paul Miller,"I recently upgraded my TicWatch from TicWatch Pro 4G to the TicWatch  Pro 3 Ultra GPS. This watch is awesome. First and foremost, the screen is crystal clear. Even the quickest of glances is rewarded with clear, crisp content. What I am enjoying even more are the health monitoring apps. From blood oxygenation to heart rate monitoring to sleep tracking, the watch provides the ideal mix of the most desirable smart watch components - most of which were not available on the previous model. Lastly, and much to my surprise, the watch is slightly slimmer than it's predecessor, feels lighter, and boasts the longer battery life. My new Pro 3 Ultra has consistently surpassed the battery life of its predecessor. I have yet to run it to it's maximum, which in and of itself is a good thing. On the down side, this watch has a completely different dock type which means if you have the older model you cannot use as a backup charger. Overall I highly recommend this upgrade and look forward to building my health portfolio with this watch as a key component in data capture."
Mark Robertson,"I owned this watch for about 5 1/2 months - it was mostly decent, though the sleep tracking was sometimes questionable and there were a few erroneous readings that couldn't possibly have been legitimate (a pulse ox dip from 98% to 76% back to 95% in a matter of a minute or less, for example).The big ""buyer beware"" though, is in the fact that it specifically advertises itself as ""IP68 Waterproof Rating and Pool-swimming Suitable"", but buried in the product page it also states:""The following conditions may especially affect the waterproof performance of TicWatch and should be avoided：...Contact with salt water, chlorine, perfume, solvents, detergents, acids or acidic foods, spray insecticides, lotions, sunscreens, oils, or hair dyes....""I had taken the ""Pool-swimming Suitable"" statement at its word and hadn't noticed the buried disclaimer, but after a short time in a pool, the watch vibrated briefly then got very hot. I was able to turn it off, but couldn't turn it back on. I contacted Mobvoi about the issue, expecting that this would be covered under warranty, but was told that since the pool I had exposed it to had chlorine I voided the warrantee so while they would give me a coupon code for a discount off a new watch they wouldn't be replacing my now-inoperable one.Which raises the question - where would anyone expect to find a pool that is neither chlorinated nor salinated that would make this watch ""pool-swimming suitable""?"
Mark Robertson,"*** DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH. I have had this watch for 6mth now. I am an athlete, so yes I push the limits as far as accuracy is concerned.Why did I choose this watch?I chose this watch as it was due to get the WatchOS3 update (its been out on other watches for a year now) and didnt want to buy a watch and then upgrade to another watch just to get the OS3 update. Well we still wait and wait. In the meantime the MOBVOI app is a complete disaster. Takes time to update on your Cell phone, its laggy and it just a tardy written app, not professional at all. The sleep patterns are all over the place ( I have slept with other watches on my arm testing against the TWP3). The GPS (Cycling) is way off despite many calibrations  and software reinstalls.Another really annoying feature of this watch is the nigh time Essential mode - its so bright you need to cover your eyes with your pillow and it doesn't matter what setting you set.Theres probably more but - GIVE THIS WATCH A MISS. There are other less pricey watches that offer more."
Matthew Mastenbrook,I own a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and wanted something with better battery life so I picked this watch. It is a well made watch and the Wear OS is nice but I'm not overly impressed by the watch itself. To me it's not as responsive as my Samsung and doesn't feel as premium. The secondary screen is nice but it lights up at night when you move so wearing it to sleep track can be annoying. You can fix that by putting it in theater mode every night before bed but for $299 there should be away to disable it without having to do that. One of the main reasons I wanted it was for the extra battery so I could wear it to track my sleep. I will stick with my Samsung and just charge it before I go to bed and track my sleep that way. All in all it's a nice watch but just not the watch for me.
ash,This watch had a great battery for a smart watch.  I walk 4 miles a day and the tracking is spot on firte steps and distance.  With tracking on I still get 2 days of battery.
Amazon Customer,"Great looking and functioning smart watch if you’re looking for a cheaper alternative to the Apple Watch. Being an iPhone user, I receive phone call and text notifications; however, I cannot reply to texts nor answer phone calls from the watch like you can on an Apple Watch. For me, this is not a deal breaker at all since I typically do neither from my Apple Watch anyway. So far, the workouts, sleep tracker, and other functions work great. The Wear OS and dual screen look great. I’ve gotten about 2.5 days of battery life before needing to charge. Highly recommend!"
Gray,"I do a lot of distance running in a variety of conditions and the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra has proven to be a rugged companion during my initial weeks of ownership.  The always-on LCD display is readable at a glance in pretty much all lighting conditions.  Something that's very much appreciated when trying to see the time, with older eyes an hour into a dark, rainy run.I've owned a few different WearOS based watches and the Pro 3 is noticeably faster (smoother scrolling, app launch times) than watches running on the older 2100 platforms.  The companion app works well, and I especially like the 24-hour physical and mental status monitor.I generally charge the watch while I'm getting my morning shower and that's enough to keep it topped off.  If you're going to be away from an outlet, I'd estimate a few days of power with all of the sensors turned on."
Tabitha Ledesma,"Most everything about this watch has been perfect. All the features I wanted, plus a few I didn't know I needed.The only complaint I have is the battery life. Reading other reviews before purchasing, most commented about how great the battery was. I'm not sure if mine is faulty or I have an app running unknowingly, but mine certainly would not last 2 days. In less than 24 hours, it's generally at 30%. And at least 10% of the battery drains while I'm sleeping.Beyond that, it's been a great upgrade from the fitbit versa I was using. And having a Google pixel, it's been a seamless connection."
Tabitha Ledesma,"I bought this watch after my Ticwatch Pro that I had for three years died. 😔The battery life is incredible. I can go 3-4 days on one charge. Another thing that I like is that the low-power mode shows not only the time but also the date, the seconds, steps and a battery icon.I can wholeheartedly recommend this watch to anyone. It's totally worth it!"
Frogroast,"The new ticwatch is a great upgrade from my previous ticwatch pro 4g. The new design and build is sleek and strong, and its thinner and lighter than my last watch. The batter life is fantastic, lasting around 3 days of casual use before I felt the need to charge it. I apricate the fact that they kept the watch band size 22mm, so I was able to easily swap over my nice leather band from my last watch. I am still a huge fan of the dual layer display, and the new improvements to that display are great, and adding a backlight to the essentials mode was a great feature to add.The new charger is smaller and more compact, which does mean the watch doesn't sit as nicely on it, but it charges fast and you dont have to charge it super often so its not a super big deal.Overall, another great product from mobvoi."
superbrain,"I've been using this watch for a couple of days now, the performance better than what i have expected, since I have used Ticwatch Pro 3 GPS before I can say that this Ultra edition will give you same performance with some extra benefits related to health monitoring capabilities.The improvement to the FSTN screen enhances the visibility of the watch in open areas a lot,  watch battery life is very good I've charged it fully in Thursday and went to a trip for 3 days at Sunday 20% of the battery charge was still there and I should have return home by next day, I switched the FSTN as the primary watch mode which kept the watch running till Monday next day.Since this watch will receive Wear OS 3 from Google soon I expect that the watch performance, batter life and other features will be enhanced significantly as the watch has all the hardware and customization which enables it to achieve that."
krlosRD,"These observations are after 3 weeks of experience. Battery is usually about 75% with always on feature, 80% if not using always on when I retire for the night. There is a slight difference in step count between the Mobvoi app and Google fit but I think that is to be expected. Heart rate is fed to both apps. The watch is convenient for checking heart rate on walks, the O2 sensor has not worked well while walking but does record throughout the day. The watch is comfortable to wear and should be worn snug for the sensors to work well."
Carlos Arroyo,"This is a great watch.  It's packed with great features.  I upgraded from the Ticwatch Pro GPS to the Ticwatch Pro 3 GPS to the Ultra and I'm very impressed. I have tried competitors' watches and when it comes to battery life (which is probably one of the most important features for me) there's no comparison. The dual display technology is also very innovative with its color-changing tech. None of the competition has that. I also like how everything syncs flawlessly into Google fit.  Things like sleep cycle,  heart rates, and stress levels all show up in the Google fit app. I could only get that to happen with competitors' watches with third-party apps which were buggy. All around, this watch is great."
Amazon Customer,"I would rank this watch a 5 I love it but it hasn't upgraded to the newest watch os. At this point it is not available, it was supposed to be available over a year ago."
Amazon Customer,I've had the watch for close to a month now as a daily carry.By far the more stylish and functional watches that you can get for the money as an android user.Especially like the NFC feature!One aspect of the watch that I would like to see improved would be the battery life. I needs a recharge like every other day if you are using it often. That would be my only complaint thus far.
Derek JW,This is a nice watch. It is a bit difficult to connect with the software. If it was less expensive it would be great 👍🏽
John Harvey,"Updating the original review after 10 months of use (2*):Having used the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra for 10 months now, overall, it's been a decent experience. At times, the watch has been a little sluggish. However, overall, it's been a positive experience.However, the waterproofing on the device has now failed. I wear the watch for swimming (which is fine as it's IP68 rated and Ticwatch says it's fine). However, as I have worn the watch when showering after swimming, they claim this breaks their warranty (even though the water environment is far less than swimming). Given this, I honestly can't recommend this device, or, at this point TicWatch. After being a long-time supporter, it's disappointing to see a company try to hide behind such a ridiculous constraint in their warranty policy.Original Review (5*):I purchased the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra as an upgrade from the previous TicWatch Pro 2020. The new watch is a huge upgrade from the old hardware with a much improved experience with speed and overall functionality!The many watch faces give you plenty of options for customization and with the watch using a standard strap size, you can even change the straps as well for whatever look you want. There's one minor feature which doesn't allow you to change the temperature units on some faces without changing your cell phone language but support have included this as a feature request.Notifications work flawlessly, NFC payments using Google Pay work flawlessly, exercise tracking has also been great and battery life is excellent - everything is just so responsive and the watch is a pleasure to us. Highly recommended and will only get better with the future upgrades to WearOS."
John Harvey,"I bought this watch about 4 months ago. Its been working okay, although the battery life has always been very poor even though I have many features turned off and barely touch the screen. It came out of the box needing to be charged twice a day, to the point I can no longer track my steps or sleep because it always is sitting on the charger...BUT none of that matters anymore, because without warning it stopped tracking sleep, steps, HR and oxygen about a week ago. This happened once before but I was able to save it by deleting and redownloading the apps and restarting the watch. Not this time!What a waste of 300 dollars, the quality is much more what you'd get for $20- 30. Also, it advertised GPS but that function hasn't worked the whole time I've had the watch as its ""not supported"" by the company and they refuse to upgrade. Horrible customer service, no help has been offered any time I reach out about it. My return window unfortunately closed, but I learned my lesson- Mobovoi is shady, I will not be buying from them again. Don't waste your money."
Jodie L Laulusa,This watch can be compared with any other expensive I have other smart watch except for Apple (not a fan).this one is very accurate and watch faces are nice. I do not regret having bought this watch at all.
Trevor Jensen,"I have had the watch for serval months now and it is not what everyone says it is. First this was the first watch able to run wearOS 3 but the company is to lazy to move to it. Second the sleep tracking work 3 to 4 days a week even then it thinks if I get up at 3 am to go to the restroom for 3 minutes I am up for the day. I do not like Samsung because I do not have a Samsung phone and some apps do not work with my phone, but it is a better watch. The new google Pixel watch is way best as far smooth and speed. Anyone saying other is Lying or work for Mobvoi. Do not buy you wil not get any support!"
Trevor Jensen,"Great watch for a great price. Battery life is great, lasts two days before needing to be charged. Looks classic and has a comfortable band. Interface is very easy to use. Gestures are a littly finicky but it is easy to control. Screen is big and crystal clear."
ricky,"I bought the Tic Watch 3 Pro Ultra not even six months ago. After only four months, I noticed the exact same battery drain and lack of charging that occured on my TW Pro 3. This occured with no outside apps, no Bluetooth connect, and always running in essentials mode. I also factory reset the watch three times before deciding enough was enough.Too bad the TW Pro I originally bought was outside the return window or it would be heading back also.  Please fix the battery issue on an otherwise fantastic product."
ricky,"I tried the TicWatch Pro and TicWatch E and decided to try the Ultra given a few enhancements over the Pro. Something I use daily is the Walk exercise which uses the GPS. Unfortunately, this watch is, of the 2 other 4100 processor watches, the slowest to acquire a GPS signal. Seriously, we are talking for several minutes. Doesn't sound a lot but you are standing on the street looking like you are waiting for an overdue Uber! At times it feels as if it is not going to acquire a signal.  How is this possible from the latest, greatest (?) TicWatch? Why has Mobvoi not implemeanted GPS assist? Be warned."
Jenny G.,"I love that it's running WearOS without any skins on top. I thought it would be bulkier/heavier/bigger, but it's not that bad at all. Battery life is better than the other Fossil watch I tried. It also doesn't get anywhere nearly as hot as the last Fossil watch I had. Can't wait until Google releases WearOS 3.Reason for 2 out of 5 stars is just because I do think that the Samsung watches are more accurate, and offer more. I just hate all the bloatware that Samsung has, and that you have to use Samsung apps for the watch to work. As well as if you don't have a Samsung phone, you lose some special features that only work with Samsung watch + Samsung phone.I updated it from 4 out of 5 stars, to 2 out of 5 stars because I started noticing that the heart rate tracking has gotten really bad, and the sleep tracking seems to be having issues lately. The first week or two, it was doing decent, but as I kept using it, it's just been getting worse and worse. Half the time it can't track my heartrate when I'm walking/exercising and even sleeping. I've tried to tighten the watch on me, and loosen it. Tried both left and right wrists, nothing. Haven't even gone swimming with it on, taken it off every time I showered.. It was in rain for maybe a minute, but it wasn't raining horribly. I've done the ""power it off and power it back on"" to see if it would fix the issues, but it doesn't seem that it did."
Jeff Huso,"Poor sleep tracking and battery performance make this a poor watch despite competing with far greater options at it's price point.The first night I used it the sleep tracker did fine, however each night after the watch stopped tracking my sleep after less than 2 hours and even after resetting to factory settings it never seemed to think I was asleep for more than an hour or so each night.  Seeing as tracking my sleep is one of the primary reasons Im using the watch this instantly disqualified it for me.The battery life is also quite poor.  With only the 24hr heart rate monitor active I could only get about 24-36 hours of life before needing to charge the watch.I also found my self unsure of which set of apps to use with the watch.  The device comes with a set of fitness and tracking apps called Tic*whatever but it's also programmed with all of the WearOS googleFit apps and you're kinda forced to choose which one to use and felt like the other is just taking up space.  They should just stick with their proprietary apps or commit to using the WearOS ones.The screens are nice but I didn't love the watch face choices.I tried this watch side-by-side with the Garmin Venu 2 Plus and I'm keeping the more expensive Garmin."
Frogroast,"Sleep tracking is not accurate, step count is a little off but my big issue is the vibration motor, it sounds like a tattoo needle, not sure if this is the norm or I have a bad unit"
superbrain,"I have passed through several Wear OS watches, Huawei, Michael kors (gen 2 & 3) and Fossil (gen 4 & 5)  and none ever got close to the performance and battery life that the Ticwatch 3 Pro Ultra offers. The only thing missing is to have a LTE global version (there is only one for Europe). 2 day battery with absolutely everything on (including audio notifications). This Watch is the best, and if a US friendly LTE version is released I'll get it on a heartbeat, because it will be a Wear OS equivalent of an Apple Watch."
SportyRydr,"First the good.  It does great as a smart watch.  It does a great job of sleep tracking, and the heart rate seems to be very accurate compared to a chest strap?  Now the bad.  I like to run and ride my bike without my phone to escape for a while.  That is why I liked that you can download music on the watch.  Well, if the watch is connected to a phone, the GPS is spot on (see first tracking in the photo).  If you track without the phone, it literally takes MINUTES to even get a GPS signal, and then it tracks crazy (see the second and 3rd tracking of the same route I run in the mornings).  It did the same with my bike rides.  So disappointing.  Guess I will go back to my Garmin Venu 2.  I wanted this to replace that since it is bigger and has Wear OS, but I need accurate GPS readings."
SportyRydr,"I truly tried to like this watch.  Really.  Maybe it was not having Wear 3.0, idk.  Maybe it was the fact that I couldn't have it tell me my calories, heart rate and distance thru my headphones.  Maybe because it was the fact that I had to download numerous other apps to get it to 'semi' communicate with my phone (Note 20 Ultra) the way the Watch 4 did...but just barely.  Maybe it was because in reality, with what I need to be running on the watch 24 and 7, the battery was no better then they watch 4.  It also could have been that the Mobvoi app never truly synced with Fit.  Pretty badly actually, like missing my daily workouts.  And the proprietary charger?  Good luck with keeping that on the watch.  Yeah, no, this watch isn't for me.  Maybe it is for you, give it a try, but be ready to sit down for hours trying to set it up the way it takes MINUTES to do with a Galaxy Watch.  I cannot recommend it."
Amazon Customer,I am just going to be blunt and discuss the things that I didn't like and ultimately made me return it. Before diving in I will say I enjoy many things from the watch and hate that I had to part ways.1) the vibration motor is not only weak but you can hear it too. It really makes the watch seem cheaply made. I missed notifications at time because of this.2) The LCD is mostly useless. The step counter was off more times then not. I searched and found reddit posts speaking about similar issues(not just me). A reboot would usually fix the issue but it happened to often.3) No notification indicator on the LCD screen. Either have an indicator or keep the notification up until the user dismisses it. Due to #1 I missed notifications.4) Needs a rotating crown. The top crown should be used to scroll up and down with such a big screen.
Carlos S.,Como hago para comunicarme con soporte para este reloj no he podido estoy en Colombia
John Bottalico,"It works ok, but... Don't get it wet.When several sensors stopped working after about 9 months, the first question from warranty support was whether I had worn it in a shower or bath. No, but I had worn it in the pool though... They did approve the warranty return, but I must admit I was hoping for better performance from an IP68 rated watch in this price range. I guess the replacement won't see much water at all :-("
John Bottalico,"The look, style, SPEED, and response is fantastic.  It is ruggedized all on its own... still use protection though. The dual screens is great and battery life is two and a half days... it could be more or less, I'm an average user. Find on a sale on Amazon and you will not be sorry."
Constanza F.,"Having been an early adopter (since crowd funding round), this is my 3rd  of TicWatch evolutions.Each time I look at what is on the market and they have always seemed to have better tech/features.I bought the watch and it happened to show up a day before I left on a Biz trip.Of course I charged it and it was super easy to setup and connect to the Mobvoi app.The 1st generation was not as user friendly.I left for my trip and of course forgot to put the charging cable in my bag. Well ~3 days in and the watch's battery was still going .The OS and added apps have been great and super fast.Love it !! Bring on Gen 4"
Constanza F.,"GREAT Watch!! Comfortable, Battery lasts for days! This is my 4th watch, I've had them since they came out, very durable and strap is comfortable does pull my arm hairs. Does everything a smart watch should do."
_Pete_,Wear OS 3 was supposed to be available for this watch in December of '22.  Still nothing at the end of March '23.  Going back to the Pro LTE.
Oldfossy l,"I had a FitBit that was recalled because of batter issues. I looked for a Fitbit replacement watch that worked for me. Could not find one. So I looked at other brands, this brand seemed to stand out with both styling and working apps. I made the correct choice! Fantastic styling, all Android apps worked. Fit Trackers are amazing, being able to accept texts and phone calls is an amazing feature that my old FitBit could not do.Oh ya, I forgot to say that my phone is a OnePlus 10Pro. This TicWatch works for the OnePlus line of phones!"
brandon,"The new smartwatch from Ticwatch, Pro 3 Ultra GPS, is a fantastic watch.Looks - The watch looks great with black bezel.  It is light weight compared to my Ticwatch Pro 2020.  Although 47mm but it does not look big on my wrist.  It's just perfect.Performance - Performance is awesome with no lags or anything.  It has latest chip with 1 GB RAM. The display is superb.Battery - I'm getting 3+ days per charge with more than normal use as I am playing with it since I received it.Features - Loaded with features like water resistant, GPS/Speaker/Microphone/Fitness tracking/Heart rate sensor/ Oxygen sensor etc.Summary - Love the watch.  It's the best WearOS watch that's on the market.  I highly recommend it."
jsky,"This was a nice watch at launch, however, Mobvoi has demonstrated that they are either unwilling or unable to support their devices after launch. They promised a Wear OS 3.0 update for this watch, then went completely silent at the end of 2022. When they finally responded to all of the questions, it was with a vauge ""we're looking into it"". They have not updated any of their other devices. This particular watch received ONE security update.On the hardware side, one of the buttons started sticking and barely works. I didn't even use this watch that much, as I had other smartwatches to rotate between. I can't imagine how it holds up for someone who uses it daily.So, don't buy this or any other Mobvoi Watch. They will no update them. They will just release another one in a year and expect you to buy it. If you want software support, buy a Pixel Watch or a Galaxy Watch. Even the Galaxy Watch 4 has received more updates than this watch and it is on Wear OS 3.0.This is the last Mobvoi product I will ever buy."
KB,Loved this until right after the return window closed and it stopped working.  As you can see from the picture looks like a watch version of the blue screen of death.  Pretty ticked off that it only lasted just over a month!!!Buy at your own risk!
Frogroast,This is such an awesome watch and would be even better is Google just stopped brown nosing Samsung and let the rest of us get WearOS 3.0.I went from Galaxy smart watch to the Ticwatch because of the silly prices charged by Samsung in my country. I dont regret it - I've been using it for about 6 months now and love it!
superbrain,"El TicWach 3 pro ultra PK39 (wh12018) tiene el podómetro muy sensible, él está contando demasiados pasos, lo he comparado con el podómetro de mi teléfono celular  o con mi antiguo Amazfit gtr 2  y puedo afirmar que hay una diferencia abismal. Esto hace que los datos de salud se demasiado inexactos, además, parece que no tiene sincronía del conteo de paso con la app FIT de google, nunca voy a a ver los mismo datos en el reloj y en la app de google.El reloj tiene mucha imprecisión por ejemplo en el altímetro, yo estoy a 536 msnm y en los resultados del ejercicio de ciclismo la elevación registrada  fue de 900 a 1000 msnm.El asistente no puede realizar una simple orden de llamar a un contacto o en algunos casos la imprecisión de los ppm, en fin, muy decepcionado.Por cierto la duración de la batería con todo el seguimiento de salud activado es de 2 dias.Despues de 1 Mes de uso quiero un reembolso pero ya no podré solicítalo, quizás un RMA?Señores Mobvoi  recuerden que la competencia está a la vuelta y por  menos $300 dolares ofrecen un mejor dispositivo.Les recomiendo leer los foros del fabricante antes de comprarlo, no comentan el mismo error que yo."
Randy Johnson,Im new to the whole smartwatch thing ... I wasn't sure which one to buy ... I am so glad I went with this one ... The wear os operating system works flawless ... I work construction so I need something that could take a harsh work environment and this watch does it all and more .... If you are unsure about this watch don't be it is great all around...
David Perrotto,"My original Galaxy Watch died after almost 5 years. I didn't realize how good that watch was until I started looking for a replacement. Based on the reviews on Amazon, the Tickwatch sounded like a good option. Within 24hrs it was clear that it wasn't for me.1.) The secondary display triggers all night long waking me up. I turned on theater mode which turns off the display. Unfortunately in this mode, YOU CAN'T TURN OFF THE ALARM!!! Seriously, it's a known issue discussed on the Mobvoi forum for the past year.2.) Second night, I tried essential mode. I'd lost sleep tracking, but at least I would get some sleep and have an alarm. WRONG! In essential mode, the alarm is disabled. Again, this is discussed on the forum, with no solution from Mobvoi. They have the ability to turn off essential mode, but apparently that also don't work reliably.3.) Third night, I tried just covering my watch under the sheet. That resulted in the watch getting stuck in bootloader mode. I presume I hit some combination of buttons throughout the night.Minor issues:1.) Like almost all smart watches there is zero crown to protect the display. The display will get scratches and probably cracked in long term use. It seems to be universal, even Samsung is dropping the crown on the Galaxy Watch 5. Just a bad design.2.) Battery Life was just ok. 76%-6% in 48hrs.3.) Heart Rate never seemed to work. It only captured a couple data points each day.4.) Secondary Display is bright. Primary display is dim and low contrast.It's being returned."
David Perrotto,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Looks beautiful and work perfect until I  went for a swim to the kiddie pool, nightmare after that it started beeping non stop, try restarting didn't work, left it overnight charging and this morning will not start, manual said is ok for swimming, it is likely that it was not seal properly from factory, new one is on the way, either way I will take it of my wrist before I get into the water, I love the look and functionality."
Randy M,"The 3 day battery life in smart mode is most likely done with minimal functionality, as I only have 24hr heart rate monitoring and sleep detection enabled and it only lasts about 8hrs. While this is not terrible its not ideal to charge it every day to be able to use its sensors."
Larry,"Have absolutely nothing bad to say about this watch. Comfortable, light, responsive, battery efficient, stylish, and customizable. Plenty of watch faces with any information you could available. When they say you can get 72 hours of use off one charge they weren't kidding. Have that battery stats to prove it. Bought the TicWatch Pro 2020 and was more than happy with it. This watch is worth the money. Between countless personal/work emails, all social media messages and numerous texts, it doesn't skip a beat. Have to love the essential face. Time, steps, date and battery level without having to wake it. Owned Fossil, Samsung, and Asus watches but this brand takes the cake. If it matters I'm using a Samsung Note 10 Plus 5G."
Chad Pratt,"The only compass function is thru phone gps, so if you are not moving, or not connected to/don't have your phone, you have no way of knowing direction thru watch. Downgrade from 2020 ticwatch pro version, and my 2016 LG sport watch.Otherwise appears to be a great watch, if you don't want to know directions by pointing your arm or the watch"
Universal Engineering Sciences,"Really like this watch,  has android OS, very responsive,  two screens,  just wish the oxygen sensor was more accurate, as I have sleep apnea and want to monitor my oxygen during sleep.I don't know if any watch would do a better job though, or of this is as accurate as they get on the wrist."
Joseph A.,After the first 45 days of basically decent service...Unless you are in Essential mode - dont expect even 24 hours on a charge. With even the most basic watch faces I wasnt getting 12 hours. In essential mode I get about 2 weeks.MUCH less than the 45 days touted by the manufacturer.
Joseph A.,"Have a bunch of Samsungs and have to say only after 1 day of usage this is my all time favorite smartwatch to date its beautiful, fast Intuitive just cool if you like Smartwatches this is absolutely one of the best"
Big Sack Jack,"Buen reloj con un excelente rendimiento, me llama la atención que no puedo contestar llamadas ni agregar Google Pay."
IsidaAfc,"Upgraded from the 1st gen TicWatch Pro, and the first major change we noticed was that the battery life was much improved. I went from 1.5-2 days per charge to a running average of 4 days per charge.The updates to the hardware also caused the device to be much thinner and lighter as a result. The updated display was also welcome, as having a backlight for the low power LCD screen helps readability throughout the day.The heartrate sensor, and O2 sensor both seem as accurate as I could expect, and barely make a noticable impact on the overall battery life."
Steve Green,"Used this smartwatch for several weeks.  Well built, easy to use and feature rich.  Battery life is good for this category/price range.  A worthy alternative to a Samsung Watch 3 and the other watches in this price range."
Frogroast,Le falta algo de precisión al momento de reportar actividades físicas como montar en estrava. Las aplicaciones no funciona tan mal.
superbrain,Too much Mobvoi bloat ware.  Wear OS 3 was promised Q3 2022.  Still waiting.  Will not buy another Mobvoi product.  Should have gone with Samsung.
Ken P,"me encanta, por el hecho de que tiene una autonomía muy buena, el acoplamiento con mi teléfono es muy rápido, en las llamadas esta súper genial, lo uso como accesorio para no sacar el teléfono cada que llega una notificación, recomendable 100%, espero que sigan actualizando el Sistema Operativo"
Joshua,"Responsive and fast compared to other ticwatches, GPS takes forever to get a lock (similar to ticwatch S2), battery life great in essential mode. I can generally get two days from light use. Watch face scratched within a couple of days and I don't even remember bumping it against anything, then got another one a couple days later. Treat it with kid gloves! Apart from that, highly recommended."
Amazon Customer,"Amazing watch!  Battery life  was a very important factor for me.  This watch definitely does the job.  Premium  feel high quality material.  Love it.  I had the galaxy g4 classic.  Beautiful watch.  But couldn't make it thru a day without battery dying.  Also tried amazfit.  Very nice watch but lack a few bells and whistles.  But very solid for price point.  But the ticwatch pro 3ultra gps ,Highly recommend!"
Mitchell,"I researched this watch for over a month looking at as many YouTube videos and reading comments about the watch. It amazes me all these people talking about how great the battery life is.....I finally got my Amazon credit card and pulled the trigger....boy did I shot myself in the foot with this. Nether of the apps are any good ""Google or mobvi"" 90%of the settings you have to use the watch. Google has a few for notifications and watch faces but that where it ends. Google fit is pretty useless. IVE TURN ALL NOTIFICATIONS OFF EXCEPT TEXT AND PHONE CALLS and still only two day battery life. I've turn the screen brightness down and the ringer off just vibrate, GPS is off, just about everything you can think of is off and two day battery life. You can't even check the software on ether of the apps or update it, it all has to be done from the watch. Needless to say I returned it and I'll keep looking. I hope all the 3.0 software is worth it because 2.3 sucks. Also if your going to make a Google watch make Google software the only software."
Jon Canoy,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Getting used to product- did not know have to keep App open on phone to receive alerts and messages. After 10.5 hours battery life flashing. I can not get battery to last longer than 12 hours. Very comfortable and great look. Disappointed in battery life. UGH!
Jon Canoy,"At at first blush I was smitten with this watch! It was better than my previous Samsung watch and was a whole lot better than the Amazfit watch that I gave up on because of its severe limitations! However after just two days owning this watch, the screen cracked straight through from Top to bottom! Mind you this is not subject to abusive use! Since I owned it for so little time I simply returned it and am replacing (currently processing) it with another hoping that it was just a flaw in this particular unit. Fingers crossed because I so want to like this watch. It does have everything I'm looking for and hoping that my replacement will be better.  Huge conclusion - I will be getting a screen protector since I experienced this flaw but I really shouldn't have to since this is the gorilla glass!"
Amazon Customer,"Wonderful watch so far, my ticwatch pro case and screen protectors fit fine, so that was great, watch performs well and is tracking my metrics well enough that I get an idea of what is going on.I really love the watch and it feels like a smartwatch of the future. I love how the watch is very customizable with the lcd colors and easy to switch out bands.Overall loving the watch, I look forward to using it daily.Also did a morning swim with it, and it works fine, no issues here. Just a lovely piece of technology."
Vance Souders,This does everything I'd like it to with more!  The only reason I dropped it one star was due to the battery life.  When I get home from work I let it charge to 100% then put it on before bed.  When i wake up its at 70-80%.When I get home the next day my battery is normally at 30-40%.  I feel like I'm not getting the advertised battery life of 3 days.  I'm sure I could turn off the sleep monitoring or health features to get it up to 3 days but if I turned that stuff off I'd just wear my normal watch.  Honestly it's a great watch! Just wish I didn't have to charge it every day.  Had to change this to 1 star.  Called Amazon to get a replacement and they wouldn't send me a replacement till I send my current one back.  I don't want to be without a watch.  I think I'm going to buy a galaxy 5 and then send this back.  Sucks about everything because I like this watch the battery life is just bad at 1 day
Vance Souders,"Some times heart rates were double than true. Difficult to see stats, limited graphs. O2 also without accuracy. I don't recommend it."
Amazon Customer,"I bought this for my husband this past Christmas and he loved it until he got it a little wet and it stopped working this is what my husband has to say about this. We are very upset with how the company mislead us and refused to replace it.From my husband:This was probably the best watch I've ever owned! UNTIL I got it a little wet in my pool while doing routine maintenance. I was cleaning the skimmer and my watch went into the water, about an inch deep for only a second or two...which I thought would be perfectly fine for a watch that is ""swimable"". Turns out, right after this happened, my watch started vibrating continuously until it died! Every time I try plugging it in, now that it's been a couple days, it wont charge past 2%. I contacted the company explaining the situation, and because I've kept it on in the shower (which I thought a swimable watch was good for) it is not covered! But if I want to submit a ""Repair"" I can, and have no clue how much that's going to cost, even though 300 for the watch apparently wasn't enough. This is ridiculous! I loved the watch up UTIL this! Something that you can swim with while wearing, but don't get it wet from a shower, swimming in a pool that is chlorinated, salt water...or you know, ANY WATER AT ALL or it will void the warranty!"
Felix Underhill,"All the apps help me to keep control of activities, make better goals on my daily basics"
Andy,"Since I have had this watch I haven't received any update, It's still on Wear Os 2.38 😑"
Frogroast,Did not feel sturdy like the Samsung watches and it rattled inside
superbrain,My husband is obsessed with this watch. The battery lasts as long as advertised and he is using it constantly. He is super happy with this purchase.
Mohammad Elkhleifat,Great battery life. Fast and responsive. Sleep tracking even in essential mode though you won't get oxygen measurements. New backlight color for essential mode is very nice. Swimming rated.  Near perfect for way less than an apple watch. Hands down best android wear watch. Oh and it takes standard quick change bands if you want to change your look. I love that it looks like a real watch.
Dan,Great watch and feature packed. The only reason I can't recommend buying g this watch is zero lack of software updates. Still suck on Sept of 2021 security update and it's Jan 2023.
Average Buyer,"The TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS smart watch is a premium watch that has great features. I use it to track my fitness progress and overall health. The watch has a long lasting battery and I love the essential mode. I never have to worry about the watch dying. The sleep tracking is also great. If you are looking for a high quality smart watch, I recommend purchasing the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS. You will not be disappointed."
Amazon Customer,"I liked the watch, but it stopped holding battery life. I reached out to customer service and they say wait until we resolve the issue from our end. My manufacturer warranty expired 7 days ago and I’m stuck with a watch that doesn’t hold a charge. I really liked the watch it was inconsistent at times, but overall I liked it, but after dealing with the poor customer support I was offered for the money that it cost me. I don’t think is worth it. I won’t buy this brand again."
Amazon Customer,This is my first venture into the smartwatch world. This is such a great asset. Like gluing my phone to my wrist. Plus the bio tracking that's more accurate than my phone. Love the changeable faces and all the additions of info and access at the end of my arm. Battery life is close to what they say. I use mine more as it is still new to me. Very pleased with the purchase.
Jon Choi,"This watch has spoiled me, if I take it off to charge, I find myself glancing at my wrist when my phone chimes. Tap to pay is very convenient. Battery is good, I charge it about every 3 days. Hated the silicone band, but threw a leather one on and it's perfect."
Aaron Warren,"IT LASTED 10 MINUTES IN THE POOL.Had the watch about a week.For starters that watch it's was very nice to wear and very comfortable.UI on the watch is pretty good had most of the features you would want.The phone app is leave much to be desired. You can definitely tell it's Chinese design. For security cautious folks, monitoring of the traffic on the app shows Chinese checkins.Most importantly the watch is for sure NOT waterproof. (Clearly advertised for swimming and has a swim function built in) It lasted about 10 minutes of backyard pool activity. While in the pool it got hot on my wrist and then powered off. Tried drying it out but the watch was shot. Partially powered on and would not stop vibrating then shut down. Ended up returning it."
Jonathan Crass,"Bought this watch almost 2 months ago, I expected to get the promised 3 day battery life out of it, but to my surprise it only lasts about one day. The battery level indicator falsely reports your battery percentage, leading the watch to say that it's at 80% after the day and completely die."
Honda Swedey,"This watch is great and has to be the best Wear OS Watch in the North American market. I have had the TicWatch C2, TicWatch 4G LTE, and now this TWP3 Ultra GPS. Improved performance, faster response time, improved wrist, a ton more features, backlight display in essential mode, the list goes on and on!  The only thing that is missing is the cellular version for the North American market like they have overseas. Other than that this watch is Perfect."
Gibbylove,3rd party watchfaces look grayed out in AOD. This is even worse than the previous TicPro 3. I will no longer buy Ticwatch products only because of this reason. Samsung is miles better in this dept.Other than that or if you don't use AOD & 3rd party faces it's a great watch.
Num1,"I have had so many Wear OS watches, and they were always very glitchy.  Disconnecting from bluetooth randomly, etc.  I then got a Samsung Gear (Tyzen) and it was also never quite right.  This watch is beautiful and fast and I haven't had any glitches with it!  The essential screen saves a lot of battery.One note, I enabled ""flip to wake"" in the Wear app, and it didn't work.  I had to enable it on the watch itself."
Frogroast,"I have to start by saying that I have been in the search for the perfect smartwatch and I think I found it. This watch is sleek and not too bulky and it functions as it should. The battery last 3 or more days and the apps work as they should. There are other watches out there, but they don't have the performance that this watch has it and at a reasonable price. If you are in the fence; just buy it."
superbrain,Fantastic smart watch! If you have a Google enabled smart home you can turn the lights on or off from your couch!! The battery life is excellent and last well through 2-3 days. The best part is it works well with my iPhone and integrates easily into the Apple platform. It’s a lot smoother running that my Apple Watch SE which cost the same and I get a lot bigger of a display.
Kelsey Grason,"No me ha gustado, no marca correctamente los pasos, me tiene molesto y desepcionado,muy pocas app, muy pocas faces, no se puede quitar la vibración siempre lo hace y no hay como quitarla, siento que me han robado!, Además la bateríano dura lo que dice, el brazalete muy malo, pésimo, la brújula no le funciona esta desactivada en todos estos relojes le veo la manera de sacarle provecho con tan pocas apps que hay para instalar a este aparatejo, tenía que ser chino!"

JBB,"Excellent watch with multiple monitoring options.  I use the watch to monitor sleep efficiency, heart rate, exercise activities ( multiple specific options available ) and over activity.  Highly recommended.I recharge the device about every 48 hours."
James,"I'm use to a hybrid smartwatch so battery doesn't last as long, but many other options. I love it."
bret osborne,"So far its been good, other good reviews are on point however a massive oversight is the fact that the alarm no longer works in ""Essential Mode"" which is one of the big selling points with this watch. Apparently it worked, then there was an update an it no longer works... After 6 months, it still not working so I guess having a functioning alarm on a digital smart watch's power saving mode is not a priority form the manufacturer. Other than that, its been okay."
A. Harriott,"Nice Watch But Google Assistant on ALL Google Wear OS watches does not work to make calls or send texts!  If you Google it, you will see this has been an ongoing issue for more than a year.  Google Assistant is worthless outside of telling you a joke.  You cannot get directions, make texts, make text, etc..  Also, the one I got had been open and used before and returned.  Probably for the same reason I am returning.  dumb watch, not a smart one.Because Google Assistant for Wear OS is so bad companies like Samsung are creating new products without them.Sad for companies like this that Google changed their integrations with Wear OS items and broke everyone's products.  But companies need to be honest and say this is just a little better than a heart rate monitor watch."
Hector Quiroz,"When I first got the watch, it was great. However, after a month or so it started to slow down. Finally, it shut off and is stuck a ""boot loop"" and the watch can't be fully powered on. Spend your money on a different watch.Edit: Customer service sent a new one, so I added 1 star. I'd still recommend another option."
