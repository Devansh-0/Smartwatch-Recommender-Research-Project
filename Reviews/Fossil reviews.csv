donna bullard,"You can customize just about everything on this watch, and for those who dont know how to perform the wear os 3 update properly, patience is key and so is keeping your watch charged for first hour of setting up and just keep retrying to download the updte, it will eventually run and ask you to install fter a couple of power cycles and screen glitches. Trust me the wear os 3 software mkes the watch and fossil app feature so much better and user friendly, especially with the customizations available."
Quaxo,"awesome design and quality, fast response and great battery life, lasts almost 3 days with battery saving mode, it has poor compatibility with iphone, sometimes losing connection to the iphone and needs reconnect manually, otherwise watch is great option, has 1000 of great watchfaces , health tracking and more..."
donna bullard,"If you want to be able to fast charge your Fossil smartwatch this is the one to get! Yes, its more expensive but, this is a case where I have yet to find an equivalent generic fast charging cable. This is one of the times that paying extra for an OEM charging cable is the best thing to do. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and have not had any issues."
DAVID,There are 2 things that make this watch unusable1. The charging system that it has is the worst you have to have the charger on it just right or it doesn't charge it will say it is but then doesn't and from what I have found online alot of people are having the same issues and not to mention that alot of people are reporting that the charging cable that they got is also faulty.2. When the watch died on me the first time the only way I was able to get it to reconnect to my phone was a full factory reset and I had to go through the setup againAll in all I don't suggest this watch to anyone all the videos I watched about this product said it was a great watch but like I said don't believe the hype
A_Skee,"After waiting a long time to pull the trigger on a smart watch,  low and behold Fossil came across my search engine.If you grew up with Fossil watches,  you won't be disappointed with their smart watches. They're what you grew up to love but are even better now.  If you don't mind, which I do,  having basically a ""chip"" on your body.  You'll like this watch."
Mike O'Reilly ,"Reading these reviews, it is clear not everyone knows how to use their smartwatch, which means updating their device. So before giving my review, I will use my review to educate people.First, plug your smartwatch into your charger. Tap the top of the screen and swipe down. Next, tap on the gear icon. Tap the bottom of the screen and swipe up until you see ""system,"" then tap on it to select ""system."" Tap the bottom and swipe up again until you see ""about"" and then tap on it ""about"" to select it.  Tap and swipe up (again) and select ""System updates,"" and install the available updates.  Your smartwatch will reboot, AND you will need to repeat this process until there are no more updates.Fossil, like any Android device, is not without its partnerships. Unfortunately, that is part of why the battery may drain faster; for example, you do not need two (2) heart monitoring apps. The excellent news is Fossil had the foresight not to lock in those bundled apps, and you can uninstall (remove) them safely.To bring up the list of installed apps, quickly press the middle button. A long press will bring up Google Assistant, so be sure to press fast to bring up the app menu instead. Next, select ""Play Store,"" and within ""Play Store,"" swipe down to ""My apps."" Select the app you may wish to uninstall (remove).  You can always reinstall (re-add) if you change your mind, and the system (important) apps are protected and do not have the option to remove, so you have nothing to worry about and can do this safely.In the Wear OS app (on your phone or tablet), you should also disable any notifications you do not need to be sent to your smartwatch. My phone already receives a lot of notifications, and not all of them do I need to be passed onto my smartwatch. This, too, can save battery power.Now my opinion is Fossil did an excellent job of making a smartwatch. Although this is the 1st smartwatch that I own myself, I have experienced using a few other brands (Apple, Fitbit, Samsung, Amazfit). The truth is the technology, no matter if you use Android or Apple, is not perfect. For example, if I wake up but remain lying in bed playing with my phone, it may still be counted as ""sleeping.""  And if I try to measure my exercise inside my house, taking 100 steps may be counted as only 80 because the GPS and step counting are not perfect if you remain in a confined space. This is the same for every brand smartwatch I have used; there is a small margin of error. If you are expecting absolute perfection, the technology, in general, is not there.That said, Fossil's battery, when you disable the ""always-on screen"" (located in the display setting), is suitable for well over a day with all the features enabled. The smartwatch is also durably made of solid stainless steel with a sold screen. They did not go cheap on the quality of the watch. I even took a long warm, soaking bath, going a bit above the swim test, and my smartwatch works fine. Fossil also supports both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, so I have the best of both worlds.Overall, I am satisfied with my Fossil smartwatch."
Derrick,"I resisted entering the smart watch market as not a big fan of watches.  New job changed that need so this watch seemed to meet the need of what basic functions I needed, fit the nicer look of my office attire requirements, and looked less gimmicky than other recommended watches.Two weeks in and I am liking it over all. Battery life hasn't been an issue for me as not using the heart monitor option, and the always on screen option.Still not 100% sure if Fossil control or Wear OS3 is best app for controlling the watch. I struggle finding a lot on that topic that is helpful instead of a bias complaint post.Went ahead and added screen protector recommended when I purchased watch.So far pleased with my investment"
Adam Howard,"This is a great looking watch that delivers substance too. It looks cool and more stylish than most other smartwatches, and it works beautifully. Great interface and some nice screen display options to customise the appearance.Non problems syncing with iPhone and super easy to preview messages - ideal for discreetly checking things during meetings.We bought a leather strap elsewhere as couldn’t easily find one to match via Fossils Amazon page, and the leather is super comfortable and looks great with the smoke coloured watch."
Kevin,"I added a 42 mm adhesive bezel to hide most of the black border around the display - I wish the display would just go to the edge of the glass. Forget about leaving the display on all the time, the battery won't last 24 hours like that. Otherwise, I'm very happy with it so far. Finding out how to upgrade to Wear OS 3 was slightly tricky. You can't use the app to do that! On the watch, go to Settings, then System, then System Updates. The face in my photo is from Watchmaker. You can also use Facer and other apps to get more faces. Overall, it looks just like my real dive watch now that I added the adhesive bezel (Fossil makes real dive watches, so it would be nice if they offered nicer bezels than the one this came with)."
Kath Campbell,"Watch came in a sealed box but was PIN locked upon turning it on. I had to contact Fossil support and explain the situation to them. They gave me instructions to factory reset the phone which required going into the watch settings which was impossible with a PIN. After wasting 20 minutes talking to Fossil support, I finally stumbled my way into the bootloader and found a way to reset it there the support person didn't seem to know about and I couldn't find online.To factory reset without the PIN: When the watch is off, hold the two outer buttons then press and hold the power button. Hold all 3 until the watch turns on and the bootloader menu comes up. Select recovery mode, then swipe up until you see the option to wipe all data and press and hold the power button for 2 seconds.The watch itself is nice. It's pretty heavy and feels durable. The ""leather"" and silicone strap it comes with feels kind of cheap though, but is easily exchangeable with most any 22mm watch strap. Despite the symmetrical design of the buttons, the Fossil Gen 6 does not support screen flipping for lefties who want to wear it on their right wrist."
John Quirk,"i liked it better before i upgraded it to wear os3. sure its a slick interface and pretty and zippy, it has all the fitness crap that is so important to the millenials, good for them. but once the upgrade was done, which was not seamless, i got email alerts for 1 day, now i get 0 email alerts. i have reset the device back to zero, reloaded the app on my phone, got it all back up, no email notifications. sure i get messenger and FB messenger, but email is the trifecta. i had email alerts on wear os2, now i don't. i'm going to wait this out because i paid alot for this watch, and it's pretty. but right now i'm way disappointed. i hope fossil / android fixes this because i feel a bit cheated and mislead.Update! Gmail Notifications started to work. Not really sure why, but ill take it.Apparently in was premature with  my update. It seems as long as you restart the watch and phone daily you can keep getting email updates on the phone. Samsung/Fossil / Google. Wtf? Can you not sync up on this? Wear os 2 had 0 issues with this. Go ahead and point fingers at each other but how about just fix it?Still disappointed."
John Quirk,"I bought this watch because it's compatible with a seizure alert app that I wanted to use. It works perfectly! I uninstalled unnecessary apps and that extended the battery life considerably. But even before I did that the battery life was acceptable. I use the fitness tracker with Google fit, a seizure alert app, the Alexa, and the weather app. I also use it for calls and texting. There weren't many apps that I uninstalled or disabled. I definitely recommend this smartwatch. It's the wellness version. A one-word description would be... Awesome! I was concerned about the size of the watch but that has not been a problem. It's quite comfortable and the band has not given me any skin issues. It's very soft. I bought the 44 mm size. It's supposed to be unisex. But either way it works for me. There are both masculine and feminine free watch face choices. The screen is easy to read and that's a huge plus. Again, yes I recommend this smartwatch. The Fossil Gen 6 Wellness smartwatch with Alexa!"
Quaxo,"The first three months I owned the watch it worked great. I was able to pair it with my Galaxy Note 9 with no problem. I liked the fact that I was able to readn and respond to incoming texts on the watch. The battery life was good as long as you didn't have all the bells and whistles turned on. Then I noticed one day that the watch would reboot about every two or three hours on its own. I checked to see if there were any software updates and saw that there was. I went ahead and updated the software and that is when I really started to have problems.  After I completed the software update the watch would no longer connect with my phone. I reset the watch back to factory settings and no luck. I did a little research and found out that with the latest software update the watch no longer used the Wear OS app, you had to use the Fossil App. I installed the Fossil app, uninstalled the Wear OS app as instructed. I attempted to pair the watch to my phone via the Fossil app and the app was unable to even 'find' the watch. I checked my bluetooth settings on my phone and I could see that the watch was visible and ready to pair. I was able to pair the watch to my phone via Bluetooth on my phone, but the Fossil app did not see the watch. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Fossil app and that didn't work. I was able to pair the watch to my work phone (iPhone 6S) with no issues, but I was unable to use the Facer app which I used to change the watch faces.  I reached out to Fossil tech support and let them know of the issues I was having. They responded quickly and gave me a list of trouble shooting instructions to try. After following the trouble shooting procedures I was still unable to pair the watch to my Galaxy Note 9. The phone was still able to pair with my work phone, but I don't always carry my work phone with me and I didn't buy the watch to use with that phone.  Tech support then requested that I send the watch in for warranty repair. I received a shipping label in my email and sent the phone in. I received the watch back in roughly four weeks. When I opened the box there was a note stating that they were unable to finad anything wrong wth the watch and that it was working properly. So I renistalled the Fossil app on my Note 9 and attempted to pair the watch, but the Fossil app could not find the watch and it would not pair to my phone. Needless to say I was not happy.  I figured since I had the watch I would just go ahead and use it with my work phone. My company upgraded my work phone to an iPhone 12 and when I tried to pair the watch and phone I had the same results as with my Note 9.  So now I have a watch that will not pair to either phone and is useless. I have not heard back from Fossil tech support since I got the watch back from being ""repaired"". The watch itself work great initially, but the software update rendered the watch useless."
donna bullard,Band broke in a month. Not rugged as advertised
Quaxo,"esta fabricado de buen material resistente, es pesado pero no mucho, no incomoda en la muñeca.el inconveniente es que se alenta un poco en ocasiones"
HJbunger,"Allow me to preface this review by saying that I've been wearing Fossil watches since Gen 1 and I have a background in tech, so I'm familiar with everything that's been on the market since then (including Apple Watches)/the general evolution of smart watches. Now, let's get to it. I'll keep this as breif as I can. This watch does not come with tools to remove links/make size adjustments. However, you absolutely can make all necessary adjustments with a paperclip and a little elbow grease (this is how I adjusted mine, a pair of pliers helps if you have them). Just YouTube how to remove links from a watch. It's not difficult at all. This watch comes with more links on one side than the other, so pay attention to that and count how many links are on each side to determine how many links to remove from each side as you are sizing the watch for yourself. If you have removed as many links as you can and the watch is still a bit loose, do not fret, there is a microadjustment you can make on the clasp. There are three size settings on the clasp, it comes default on the biggest size. Again, YouTube how to microadjust a Fossil Gen 6 Watch. Microadjustments on other watches are not quite the same, so I do recommend watching a video specifically for this watch for the microadjustment part. To give everyone a frame of reference, I have a very small wrist, exactly 6"". I had to remove four links and shift the microadjustment to the smallest setting to make my watch fit perfectly. This took me about 45 minutes, as it was my first time ever adjusting a watch myself. Now let's talk about voice commands. Both Team Alexa folks and Team Google Assistant folks will be able to use the robot lady of their choice on this watch. Alexa is the default, so if you're Team Alexa, the hard work is done for you. If you're Team Google Assistant, you will need to go into settings and disable Alexa. Then you'll need to long press the middle button on the right. When Google Assistant pops up, swipe down and tap the settings gear and toggle on ""Hey Google"" detection."
KQuinn,"The watch looks amazing. Good compatibility of classic appearance and smart watch. There is one problem - this is a weak charge. In my case, I have enough for 2 days, and this is after updating to WearOS 3. Despite the fact that all background functions are disabled. I stupidly use the watch as a classic watch. Basically, I don't need all these features.For a long time I tried to connect the watch with the phone. But after I plugged it in, they automatically paired with the phone."
KQuinn,"Out of the box this watch was easy to setup with my Samsung Z Flip 3 smartphone.  Load the WearOS by Google app on the phone, but then read on here.  Don't do too much adjustment of settings at first because it will want to do a software update.  Charge it, then let it do the update.  Any customization you did will be lost with the update, so just wait on customizing.  Next, another system update will probably be needed,  For this one, the WearOS app will not work and your watch will be useless.  The trick is to remove the WearOS app from the smartphone and then install the Fossil Smartwatch App instead.  NOW continue with setting up the watch.  WARNING! If you use this watch to answer your phone, then you cannot use an earpiece or car interface to do the same.  By now most phones will switch over to the carphone when it senses that but I guess that little convenience slipped by the Fossill/Google programmers.  I'm still not sure about that.  I am still in the return period and that issue may be a dealbreaker for me.  I like the watch, but the interface on the phone, the very slim face selection, and the car interface all make this software look several years old.  Hence the deduction of 2 stars.  I've had other smartwatches that had better options and a good carphone interface, all android styles, so I know this can be better.Update:  The heart rate measurement does not work well. A few counts off is expected, but mine regularly 15 counts high or more.  Fortunately I do not need to know this info, so it is just an observation. But if you really need a heart rate monitor, this may not do the job for you."
Amazon Customer,"First of all, the body, band and crystal are all Fossil and offers a smartwatch with style that is not boring and typical like an apple or Samsung. I love it. It's rugged and comfortable to wear.It's important to recognize that what is behind the crystal is quality hardware that is not uniquely Fossil. Rather, it's a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor with plenty of memory and battery. Outside of the Fossil splash screen on startup this is where Fossil ends and a quality smartwatch begins.The operating system is Wear OS by Google. This is the same as that on Samsung and tweaked some by Fossil to work with the buttons on the watch and have Fossil watch faces.Having read the negative reviews prior to buying this watch and now having used it for a month, I'd like to mention some considerations that should be made before buying.Before buying any device ask,""how am I going to use it?"" This is a fully functional device that does everything, and it comes with everything turned on and multiple apps that do the same thing. This is so you can discover all that functionality. That is definitely not the way to leave it. If you do, you'll run into some confusing scenarios, battery drain and sluggish performance.So, I uninstalled the Nike apps. I've used MyFitnessPal from UnderArmor for years. I have it on my phone and links seamlessly with Google fit that comes part of the OS. I've deactivated Alexa. Google pay links with PayPal on my phone. I've uninstalled the 3rd party pulse, O2 and step counting apps. The native apps with WearOS work perfectly with the 3rd party apps on my phone. Media control works with Pi music player.I did have to install Outlook to see MY email but that was too easy.Now that I've had it for a month, I'm totally satisfied. It is only running what I need and everything else has been removed. As such the battery it's lasting for days (3 at least).I make changes to it all the time and it's safe to say all that I have now is a stylish arm piece that does exactly what I need, when I need and only what I need.Oh, don't buy the cover glass recommended by Amazon. Get glad what is described as rounded or beveled. Though any 9H glass will protect the center of the screen is frustrating to tap the cut edge of the cover glass and have it spur and crack. Broke 3 glass covers in 2 weeks. The rounded edge is superior."
vera A KRUTA,"I like the watch. Too big. I returned it to a Amazon hub, it's taking way too long for my refund. What's up????"
Orlando,don't upgrade to wear os 3After the last update and after a whileThe watch stopped working
Victoria,"This watch has all the bells and whistles that most smart watches have. I especially love the feature of changing your face and selecting from hundreds of watch faces on the free app, (it’s called ‘faces’). The only flaw is its flimsy battery life. Mine never lasts the entire day. It’s kind of a pain to have to recharge around dinner time when other smart watches last 2-7 days. I’ve been a Fossil customer for years so they were the obvious choice when I decided to go the smart watch route. I just wish I knew ahead of time about this one flaw. I’m not sure why Fossil would not want to stay competitive with Apple and Garmin by simply installing the same battery quality as their competitors, but I’m assuming it saves them money. Still a good watch, though. Just keep a charger with you like we all do with our phones and you’ll be fine."
Victoria,"I knew going in that this watch wasn't perfect after reading and watching many reviews that pointed out its several flaws.  However, I also knew that Wear OS 3 seemed to be working pretty well on the new Samsung watches and was scheduled to be released shortly for the Fossil Gen 6, so I decided to give it a chance.  After almost a year, I've decided it was not a good choice.Performance: 1 out of 5.  The watch can be pretty smooth when it's fully awake, but it takes several seconds to get it to do anything when you haven't touched it in a while.  Many tasks jump and stutter, and often require several swipes across your screen to get a response even when the watch is fully awake, so overall it's pretty terrible.  Updates have been few and far between, and as of 8/15/22 I'm still running an Android security patch from December of 2021.  The promised Wear OS 3 update keeps getting pushed back further and further, and it's anybody's guess as to when it will finally drop and whether or not it will have been worth the wait.  It also constantly loses connection with my phone for no reason, even when my phone is in my left pocket and the watch is on my left arm.  If I wake up the watch it will reconnect after about 15 seconds, most of the time, but sometimes I'll have to go into the watch settings and turn on Bluetooth because it's randomly turned itself off.Battery: 3 out of 5.  I charge it every 3/4 of a day when running the AOD full time, meaning some days it's on the charger twice in a single day (if I take it off the charger early in the morning, it's usually back on the charger later that evening).  In theater mode it actually does pretty well, which I put it into overnight, and it only drains about 10-15% battery during 7 hours of sleep.  The charger brings it up fairly quickly, and if you pretend the battery goes to 120% you'll notice that it takes an hour or more after taking it off the charger before it drops to 99%.  I tried tilt-to-wake but it doesn't work well on this watch, and I didn't want to have to touch my watch screen to get info, so I just pay the battery penalty and run the AOD all the time for ease of use.  I work from home so it's not hard to charge it as necessary, but if you're out frequently and for long periods of time it's probably worth carrying the charger with you and topping it off when you have access to an outlet.Style:  4.5 out 5.  It looks really sharp.  A big reason why I bought this watch is due to the looks and the promise of a more ""stock"" Android experience.  The rotating crown looks nice but tends to stick, requiring an extra bit of force to break it loose and get it turning.  The included watch faces aren't anything special, but Facer is preinstalled and worth the subscription IMHO.  No complaints about how it looks.Overall I feel like this watch is in desperate need of a software update to fix some of the performance issues and take advantage of the hardware inside, but until then it's just not worth dealing with the headaches.  This is easily the most frustrating piece of technology I currently own, and I'm trading it in for one of the new Samsung watches that were just announced."
xtwoo,"The message is simple.  All I wanted---all I've wanted for years---is a watch as good as the Fossil Gen 5, but with a battery that doesn't suck.  Well, this watch is as good as the Fossil Gen 5, and its battery doesn't suck.I've been using Wear OS watches since 2014, back when it was called ""Android Wear"".  In that time, I've come to prefer Fossil watches, since they provide the basic smartwatch features I care about (handling notifications; counting steps; NFC payment; checking weather; etc.), but look like *actual watches*.  Attractive, without sticking out too much---just right!  The Fossil Gen 5 was particularly nice.  With one hardware button mapped to flashlight (super handy---try it!) and the other mapped to Google Pay, it fit my needs perfectly.Except... the battery.  Every day, it would limp along until hitting one of the ""extended battery"" modes sometime mid-evening.  A few times a month, it'd end up in time-only mode: oof.  And poker night?  Forget it: dead before I head home.  ""All day battery""... well, *kinda*.  Why couldn't I have a watch as good in the evening as the Gen 5 was in the morning?Enter the Gen 6.  The Snapdragon Wear 4100+ sets it up for significantly improved battery life.  All they had to do was *deliver*, without losing any of the good points of the Gen 5.  And they did!  I haven't given the battery a second thought since I got the watch a week ago.  Every day, it ends with 40-50%, or more.  And this is with the always-on display, which I consider essential for anything that claims to be a ""watch"".  (I'm using the Classic watch face, FWIW.)What's more, it throws in an SpO2 sensor for good measure.  The reading takes a lot longer than a dedicated SpO2, but it's nice to know I'll always have it in a pinch.Much has been made about the expected long delay for Wear OS3.  This doesn't bother me, since I'll be spending those months with, essentially, a Gen 5 with SpO2, minus the battery anxiety.It wasn't *all* roses.  I did find the setup procedure a bit clunky.  It takes a good while to finish downloading all the apps and getting everything the way I want it.Oh, and a caveat: that setup procedure seems to use a _lot_ of battery.  Don't judge the battery life on your first day experience---it's not representative!Overall, if you want an attractive, performant smartwatch, with comfortably all-day battery life, this could be for you."
nwagh1947,Battery life is horrible but the watch functionality is flawless once the software update was completed..
Nimblewan,"The watch is really clean and crispy upon opening. Take it all in, this won’t last long, since as soon as you pick it up its lack of weight is immediately underwhelming. This is likely indicative of cheap materials. Besides the watch band busting open while wearing it fitted to the wrist, the watch has no other clear signs of it being cheap. The quality of the screen is low and The feedback of the touchscreen is slow and constantly needs to be reset to connect to the phone even just to check the weather. Friends who have been on the phone with me while using the watch microphone have complained that my voice is highly filtered, choppy, and low qual. I got the watch back in october and I really held out on writing a bad review thinking maybe it’s just because i’m connecting the watch to an iPhone. Well after reviewing the forums for ages trying to figure out why users have to factory reset their watch on a weekly basis, I was motivated to write this review and save the would-be victims of this cheap junk parading around as a smart watch with a fancy face. If you are like me and didnt want a stupid squarefaced smartwatch so this handsome round faced old fashioned watch by a timeless and renowned watch maker just take my advice and keep looking. Let the watch people make the watches and the phone people make the smartwatches…. right?"
Gwendolyn J Green,"The initial charging upon receipt of the watch, resulted in a critical over heat condition that destroyed the battery. Unfortunately never got to try it. Seemed unsafe considering how these batteries burn."
donna bullard,"Screen is a good size and runs well, virtually no lag. Calls work well on it.  The only reason it's not a 4 star is right after the WearOS update they update to their custom WearOS 3.2.  This is frustrating as they remove google assistant in favor of Alexa as well as not being the latest 3.5 update that is currently out there.  It also then forces you to use there app to link the phone. The app while offering some extras compared to WearOS app it has a lot of issues.  One minor issue is it is restricting the face on the app to a certain amount of presets they have.  This is only a minor issue though as you can still change it to another you have downloaded to the watch from the watch itself.  This is the only way to get wearOS 3 on the watch right now unfortunately.  I wouldn't mind the Alexa thing if they at least gave you the option to switch back to assistant.  Overall, great watch and since it is still WearOS you get the compatibility of all the play store apps."
Quaxo,"I had a Samsung Gear watch for the last 5+ years but was a die hard Fossil fan prior to that. So when my gear started crapping out, I was stoked to go back to the brand I loved. Unfortunately, it has left things to be desired. First we will start with the application to run the watch.  The app is bare bones and not nearly as intuitive as the Samsung wearable app. There are only a few faces to chose from and very few controls to adjust settings on the actual watch. Then if you want more watch face options you have to download ANOTHER app. So 2 apps for one watch.... neither as good as the Samsung.  As annoying is that is, there are a few cool watch faces that are free or low cost, just takes some digging.Now the BIG BUMMER... The battery... well, it is terrible.  Forget about wearing it for sleep unless you are planning on charging it mid day. At first I thought it was settings,  because there was no way a NEW watch would not last a full day. Welp... I was wrong. I adjusted brightness, removed notifications,  took away so many features AND IT STILL DIES! I have gotten it to last my day but it is begging to be charged before bed. There is no way I could sleep with it and then get moving for my day. I would not last. My fear is that I have been wearing this watch for one week and already am experiencing battery issued what the heck is going to happen a year from now?So if you want a gorgeous watch with that classic Fossil design, but don't mind charging it constantly,  this is you watch! If you want something that will stay charged for a day or two, keep scrolling."
Gomati,"For starters, the watch is very well constructed and looks great. The OS is great as well. Functionality wise it has most the bells and whistles....But, it has a long way to go. For starters, I unboxed it and charged it up to 100% the first day I got it deciding that I would set it up the following day. No problems there. Day 2: Get me screen protector on, download the app on my smartphone, sync them up, and I'm ready to roll. I get through a few things and I get a message on the watch that the internal battery temp is too high so it is in limited usage mode. No worries, there is a lot to set up and link up but after this on normal usage I won't put it through so many paces so quickly. Now I'm running into issues as I continue setup as this limited usage mode is not allowing me some to finalize setup of some things. Whatever, I'll come back to those later. I am about one third of the way through and I glance at the battery life, I've been at it for 20-30 minutes and started at 100% charge... I'm now at 54%. Ok, let's take a break and come back to this later. Do a restart on the watch so it can freshen up and throw it on the charger. Day 3: I finalize a couple of the key features and notifications settings I'll be using the most and will do the nitty gritty's later after work. I didn't do much that day, had it connected to bluetooth and not WiFi, and had auto brightness on. Not a terrible amount of notifications through the day (only half of my apps are setup/synced at this point), and I get home... 42% battery life. At this point, I've lost hope. It's hard to use a watch as a fitness tracker and a sleep tracker if it can't make it through an entire day on one charge. So I start reading more and it is not even rated for that. The average charged run time is 20 hours with ""moderate"" usage. At this point I made a choice that it was time to return it and go with another option. I ended up going with a different brand that has essentially all of the same features and aesthetics, and I'm loving it. Sad to say, because it's Fossil and they are known for making good watches, but I do not recommend this watch if you plan to do anything other than tell time with it."
Gomati,"Disclaimer: I've only had it one day, so this is an initial impression. I will update in the future if I run into problems or anything changes.So after setting it up, it required two updates to get up to date. Makes sense, it's been a little while since this beautiful thing was released. I purchased a watch face called the Pixel Minimum face (as seen in the photo), and i just love it. The Fossil faces look sharp, and I might use them in some situations but in general this face is great. The sensors don't seem to be the most accurate, but are close enough.The battery life - not so great, but it charges incredibly fast, 1% about every 10 seconds. If smart features aren't required, they can almost all be disabled and should make it last quite a while as just a regular watch. Of course I hope the WearOS 3 update will better be able to handle the hardware and eek out better battery life, but only time will tell.The speaker is, lackluster, but it's so tiny I wouldn't expect it to play a concert. It's good enough for google assistant to talk a bit. Calls on it are pretty hard to hear, but again, it's a watch.. I'd probably prefer to use my phone anyway.I haven't had a chance to use google pay with it yet, but I'm sure it works just fine.Initial conclusion: It's a fast, fast charging, snappy and gorgeous work of art. It combines form and function in a comfortable to wear device. The battery, well, sucks, but considering how fast it charges it's forgivable - for me at least. The built in speaker is nice to have, but won't be something I use often to make or receive calls as it's not quite loud enough to hear without holding it right up to my ear.I would recommend this for any tech enthusiasts who also like beautiful things. It's not a dedicated health tracker, and shouldn't be treated as such. It is a smart watch that fulfills all the functions a smart watch (In my humble opinion) should, with some extra frills around the edges."
Arizona Sun,It charges my watch when I'm at work
Tyler A.,"This watch looks good and a bit heavy. The feels is quite smooth and little bumps that make the experiences feels refreshing. The starting and the response time takes a bit before smoothing out the lags. Other than those takes, the watch features is like most others with essential smartwatch apps, so there really is not much to talk about.Well, besides those apps, the watch flashlight is really just there for looks. Completely usless flashlight, well, unless one did not carry a flashlight and in the middle of nowhere in the dark and is lost."
Charles Hogg,
John M. Fiorillo,Simple and comfortable and information right there!  Great watch!
Derek d,"The watch is very nice looking.  Apps work well on it.  Easy to use.  Screen is smaller then the face of the watch, I am not a fan of the dead space of the face. Looks like they wanted bigger watch and used the same smaller screen.  Battery life will last you a long day, not much more.  Good thing it charges super fast.  Charger is nice and small and snaps right into place easy.  I have owned a few different smart watches and this is definitely not a top choice of watchs I have owned.  But, it will get the job done and you can answer calls on it.  Quality and sound is good if you are in a quite place to answer.  If they fix the face and screen to match and give a bigger battery to it, I will look at buying another Fossil.  Until then, I will stick with Tic watch."
Amazon Customer,Got this as a Christmas gift for my grandma and she loves it.
Ryan VE,as far as smart wtches goes this thing has no battery at all less that 20 hours also the step counter barely works  its a nice watch but the fitness tracking is not very good
Armstrong,No llena mis expectativas
Nick and Brooke,"The rest is not easy to navigate, sometimes  loses connection with phone"
donna bullard,"Watch looks great and fits nicely. Had to take out two links but it was easy to do. Only complaints that I have about the watch is that it doesn’t save your settings for tilt to wake or stay on screen. I usually have tilt to wake turned on and stay on screen off. This helps the battery life. But if I close the wear OS app or take my watch off and walk away with my phone, it resets itself and I have to go back and change the settings. Seems like something that could be fixed with an update if Fossil knows of the issue. Otherwise it’s a good watch, tracks my steps and has a lot of face styles to choose from so you don’t get bored of the look."
Quaxo,"Great watch. Had the explorist before this one. Wore it for 4+ years before the battery went caput. Connectivity is way better than the previous model, but still dont stray too far from your phone. Love the face options, found myself spinning the facer wheel a lot and trying out a bunch of new faces. This watch suits me though, I love the metal band, looks more ""designer"" in my opinion. Recommend a face protector though, last model had a gnarly scratch for the last couple years of use."
Matthew Adams,"Ordered for a highschooler. He loves it, but we needed a kit to resize the band smaller. Great quality, looks very grown up."
Matthew Adams,"I had wanted a smart watch for a few years. I ended up buying the Fossil after seeing decent reviews and and the promise of a incoming WearOS 3 update. This was nearly a year ago now. Still no update.The watch has become more of a chore than a helpful device. Each day I fiddle with the watch on it's charger, trying for minutes at a time to get that sweet, sweet charging symbol. Don't count on it to keep charging, though. Even if you leave it still on a flat surface, you need to check in now and again to see that it has kept charging. I have bought multiple chargers in a vain attempt to achieve reliable charging. No luck. Yes, all eligible updates have been installed. I've come to expect to find it half charged, at best, each morning.On the joyous event of 100% charge, do you achieve all day battery life? Not a chance. I was 2 hours into my day today when my watched asked me to go into battery saving mode. That's 2 hours off the charger until 30%. That's with the screen set to turn off if not actively used and the only app running being a step counter. This is standard for my experience with this watch. Pathetic.But how is performance in that short window? Terrible. Unresponsive buttons that lead to you questioning if it failed to register your presses. The touch screen works when it wants to, often failing to register my unlock pattern. It's a time consuming hassle trying to reach basic functions, often attempting 5-6 times to unlock followed by repeated swiping or button presses to reach the desired screen. What should be a quick flick and a swipe as I'm walking between tasks at work, instead requires me to stop, stare down at my watch, repeatedly trying to reach something as simple as a notification or my step count. This is far slower than just pulling my phone out of my pocket.The Fossil watch has been a complete waste of time and money. The promised update to WearOS 3 has yet to materialize, despite it being over a year since it was announced that the update was coming. Frankly, I feel lied to and ripped off. Look elsewhere for next smart watch."
Sandra Crawford,The software for this watch while a little faster than the gen 2 versions of wear. Still needs a lot more help. And it's missing a major important feature. The android assistant. Get real an android smart watch without there assistant. Alexa just does not cut it. Takes to long to get her started. And one day of battery life is not enough. It amazes me that Google and apple cannot get better battery life out of these expensive watches. This watch does look good though. I think you would do better with a Samsung or Fitbit sense. Fitbit and Samsung are better at sleep tracking. Step count. Battery life.
True Lor,"The watch is more beautiful than I expected and the screen is bright and sharp! Works well and fast, and lots of apps, watch faces and the option to have music from YouTube Music stored on the watch, to hear even when away from home or the Smartphone (to me the number one reason to use a Google Wear watch). The battery, well it was good for one day and one night on my use case, and the good news is that it would really charge in 1/2 hour, during my daily bath, so all good so far. The issue is, in three occasions when I placed it to charge it not only didn't charge but it overheated really bad that I was concerned it would reduce the battery life - nothing that I noticed though. After a research online I saw that other users were having the same issue, some reporting that it stop happening after they started setting the watch into aircraft mode before putting it to charge. Well, I concluded this is cased by a design flaw (and unfortunately Fossil is famous for other design flaws on the previous models) and I don't want to keep a product with this, so I returned. I wish Fossil had done a better job testing it to fix this before releasing it or at least fix it via a SW upload (if a matter of SW only) before I had the issue. Now, too late for me and not looking for a next Fossil watch. Coros, can you lease launch a model with OLED for me to replace my Coros Pace?"
True Lor,"With pretty standard use, and mostly the default settings, the watch lasts around 12 hours in my experience. I could see 24 hours if you turned the brightness to minimum and disabled a lot of background features. But it's not gonna last anywhere close to 24 hours on default settings in my experience.To give some precise numbers, the battery went from full to 22% in around 8.5 hours. Keep in mind, I barely touched it the whole time. Which is pretty manageable, my main problem with it is they say ""approx 24 hours""."
Darrien Johnson,"The watch is nice, but the software leaves a lot to be desired."
Darrien Johnson,"The watch looks good, and feels sturdy.The fossil app and os is pretty lacking. The watch constantly loses connection to my phone and you have to reset the watch to get it to work. Alerts aren't delivered, and the battery life is pretty terrible.It does have a clock-only feature when the battery is low, which is nice.Watch doesn't like to charge sometimes. It's very particular about how it sits on the charger, which is frustrating when the watch is dead the next day.."
Mark M,"I love the watch, but compared to other smart wtches and the apps that go with them, it really is not that great as a smart watch! It is difficult to track what you have done, where you stand for the day, etc. I tried to find previous day results, but gave up. I am comparing to Fitbit, Applewatch, and GArmin. These apps are very fluid and great to you use. So I am using this wtch along with a fitbit, in hopes that Fossil fixes their app! Battery has no functions turned on, screen asleep all the time and days after about 25 hours! Worthless."

C. Collins,I spent the whole night trying to fix this watch basically there was an upgrade from OS 2 to OS 3. To make a long story short I had given my Samsung 4 to my other half when I bought the Fossil 6 so I knew I'd be out a smartwatch when I sent this back. Anyhow when the watch upgraded to OS 3 the Fossil app recognized it the Wear OS app didn't the problem with that is you can't use the Playstore and I'd already purchased watch faces a couple of em not through Facer. So after trying anything and everything to get the Wear OS app  I tried restore all that did was get the Fossil app not to recognize it and the Wear OS app to not recognize it so I knew was licked and was sending it back. The other concern about this watch was just by charging it and going through setup it got so hot that I had to wait to try and use it after it cooled down and right now here in Idaho where I'm at the high is 37 degrees what's this going to be like in the summer in actual hot weather? Oh well I may pick up a Tick watch 4 when the price drops until then I'll stick with the Versa 3 I might have got the newest Versa if Google hadn't dissected it so they could sell their Pixel watch. So long Fitbit I suppose it was a nice run.
Quaxo,"This is a great watch. It has a sleek and modern look and it is made of high-quality materials. The touchscreen display is bright and easy to read, and the watch is very responsive. The watch is also very comfortable to wear."
Mark T,"This watch isn't worth buying right now. Maybe the watch would be better with Wear 3, but since that's not available right now, I'm not keeping the watch.Wear OS 2 is an absolute dumpster fire. I knew it wasn't great, because I've had a LG G Watch R that ran Wear 2. That watch had the 2100 processor, so it was slow and unreliable. But the battery had no problem lasting a day. Ultimately, I couldn't tell where the problems with the watch began and the software problems ended.I spent a year with a Samsung Galaxy watch, which was great as long as I had a Samsung phone. But once I moved on from the Galaxy phone, there were all kinds of quirky issues. The speakerphone and notifications would occasionally work, but more often not. The phone integration was great when it worked, but that was not the majority of the time.I looked at the new Wear OS 3 Samsung watch, but like all of the Samsung watches only play nicely with Samsung phones. So I set my sights on this Fossil Gen 6. I bought it hoping that I could live with it and wait it out until the new OS came out. But while the new 4100+ processor is faster than the old 2100, it just wasn’t enough to overcome the horrible software.Even on the new watch, lifting my wrist almost never turned on the watch screen. Notifications came in when they wanted to. And whoever wrote the notification system obviously never wears their watch. Gmail would try to ding 100 times in 2 seconds while it tried to notify you every email that came through in the last 24 hours, whether or not the notification had already been received. Maps was the worst. Trying to use the watch for navigation was beyond useless. The watch would ding twice a second constantly. I couldn’t understand what it was trying to do, and finally just turned off maps notification to shut it up. Actually, it worked better on the old LG watch, and that definitely wasn’t great to begin with.Google has given up on Wear OS 2, which would be fine if it was good software or if they were replacing it last month. But to saddle a new flagship watch with it for months without any significant improvements? Maybe the watch will be better in the fall when it finally gets the new software. But what’s the likelihood I can get a better deal on a watch after it’s been out for almost a full year? And what’s the likelihood that a newer better product will be out on the market by that point?Since Google gave up on this watch, I’m giving up on it too. Maybe if it’s better in a year, I’ll pick one up for cheap and try it again. Or I’ll just jump on the Apple bandwagon, because it works better."
V K,"Im really rather disappointed. While it has its perks. It definitely comes up short of expectations.The speaker and being able to use the watch to make calls is a nice added function, but not one i find myself using often enough. Even when i could.The daily tracking of your health stats seems ok at first. And rather accurately. But for the life of me i cant find any of my previous days/weeks numbers on the watch. As if its all stored through the 3rd party app. And only certain very basic features are tracked and available, unless you PAY for the premium package... didnt i PAY already? When i bought what now seems like i highly over priced hunk of junk, i didnt pay enough then to know what my numbers are from yesterday, or last week? My previous cheap smart watch gave me years worth of data for FREE, most of it accessible right through the watch. I hardly ever opened the app, and it was only $40 and lasted 2yrs(!) before the strap failed. Really wishing id have just bought a new strap, stupid me!Now onto the bracelet itself! TOTAL junk! The links are HOLLOW, which makes for a cheap lightweight feeling. The band is horrendously LOUD and SQUEAKS constantly! Jiggle your wrist, *squeak squeak squeak* open the clasp  *screeching*. Hold it in your hand and wobble it, *squeaky squeaky squeaky*And the battery life, PATHETIC! My previous cheapy lasted 5 days before needing a charge. This watch WONT last 24hrs after the 1st week. During your 1st week, with minimal use, youll get about 30hrs. COMPLETELY unacceptable. How are you supposed to consistently track your sleeping patterns when you have to remove the watch EVERY night for charging. I tried remembering to charge my watch BEFORE bed, but found out my watch would only die sooner the next day whenever i tried it. Id barely make it through a 9hr shift without my watch going into power reserve mode. All because i wanted to wear it to sleep.I did not get mine on sale, i paid full price, $320! Im really really disappointed... thought i was buying something id be proud to wear, instead 60 days later i hardly touch it!Just sad..... 2 stars? Hell i may have talked myself down to a 1!"
Dan,It comes with a fitness style silicone band & the beautiful leather band it comes w as well. This is by far a sexy but also people just think its a watch... He LOVES it!
GrahamRL88,"The only good thing I have to say is the watch looks nice.  The battery life is garbage, I can’t use half the functions since the OS3 update, the watch doesn’t track my steps, my sleep, anything.I’m returning this watch, I didn’t suffer through the hybrid version 5 update to deal with more problems from what should be a better product.  Honestly, between this and my service with the Collider HR, I’m probably never buying another Fossil product again.To elaborate on the battery life issue, it’s advertised up to 24 hours.  I have not used my watch at all for 12 hours and left it in “extended battery” mode, the battery is at 12%.  Why would I want a watch I can’t even use?I cannot connect my Fossil app and Google accounts, I don’t know why.  When I try to do so, the QR code provided by my watch tries to open the Wear OS app.  The watch is more work than it’s worth to me.I’m guessing the watch was made by a committee of people who don’t use smartwatches.  Hence the low (I might even say falsely advertised) battery life, the absolute fluster cluck of a companion app, and the amount of usable features locked behind access to the play store.I’d rather have no watch at all than use another Fossil watch."
Angela D,Fast and a very nice looking watch.  Nice GUI. Built in Alexa is great. Better than my Galaxy Watch.
Steven Harper,"I originally owned a Fossil 5E for a little over a year and had zero complaints. Battery life, functionality, notifications, etc. were all excellent.While in the field one day for work, I removed my watch to wash my hands in a gas station bathroom and left it there. Needless to say, I never saw it again, and figured I might as well take my misfortune as an opportunity to upgrade to the Fossil Gen 6.At first I enjoyed the new watch but within a week began experiencing a variety of issues. It started with the watch getting randomly hot - as if the processor was trying to handle something yet I wasn't using it any differently than I had my 5E. Only a reboot fixes this issue. During this time the screen would change from its always-on state to being blank and unresponsive, and require a hard reboot to get any response. This happens quite a bit.After 2 weeks with the Fossil 6, I noticed I was no longer receiving notifications from Outlook. That was one of my primary enjoyments with owning a smartwatch, not having to pull my OP9Pro from my pocket to see what the email was about. After months, I haven't been able to resolve this problem. I have the Outlook companion app installed, I've reset the watch to factory defaults and started over, yet it won't send Outlook notifications.Now, there may be a reason/caveat to my problems. I'm using the Facer app for a custom watch face, and I noticed that I had more problems with the companion app installed than without, but other problems still existed nonetheless. I don't know if this is a firmware/software issue on the 6 vs. 5E, but it's frustrating nonetheless.All I want is for my watch not to start burning on my wrist and to send me Outlook notifications. I think I'll buy another 5E and see if my problems resurface, but for right now I can't recommend the Gen 6 just for a faster processor that isn't useful, and blood/oxygen levels that require you to sit still for 20s and I'm pretty certain aren't accurate."
Chad Ainsworth,"I've only had the watch for a couple of weeks.  I've not used the activity and cardio fitness features yet and I can't comment on those.  The basic features of being an extension of my cell phone work great in terms of making and answering calls as well as Google.  It was relatively easy to set up. I say ""relatively"" because this watch could use as good manual and there isn't one.  While setting it up, a feature locked and I wanted to shut the watch off and start it up again but it took me forever to find it in an obscure place in the phone app (you push the middle button in for more than 3 sec). The biggest issue was overheating during charging.  The watch would get so hot I couldn't hold it. Actually, this is my 2nd watch.  I sent the 1st back for this reason.  When the 2nd watch exhibited the same problem, I did a Google search and found that the solution was to charge it in airplane mode.  How to get it into airplane mode? It took me a while to figure it out.  Again, no manual.  No manual and overheating are why I gave the watch 3 stars instead of 5.  Fossil really need to correct the overheating problem."
Michael,"Me gustó la compatibilidad con Alexa, sin embargo no me agradó la correa de cuero, pensaba que sería como el Gen5 Carlyle que anteriormente habia comprado por otra plataforma pero esta correa del Gen6 se veía de menor calidad."
Marvin Stasak,"The watch is one of the best made smartwatch on the market,  but due to Fossil choosing to implement a separate application from Wear OS with limited utilities and abilities, it is not any longer one of the best.Unfortunately,  until the Fossil app is vastly improved or they revert back to using WearOS my review stands."
Oscar Isaac Flores Sierra,Battery drains fast. Didn't even last for one day
C. Collins,Batería dura 1 día
Quaxo,"Ok, so I had to send back the first watch because the battery wouldn't charge. With the second watch, it resets to original settings every night. I turn off the sound, it's back on in the morning. I turn off the screen, it's back on in the morning.I haven't been able to set up the Fossil app because it won't connect. The watch will connect to my phone, but the app and the watch won't find each other. I am stuck with Android Wear OS which is really poorWish I picked a different watch. Will look at Samsung instead."
TeslaMan,"I upgraded from an older model, but not much has changed. Still a good watch though."
ecom,"This smart watch was great for the first four months or so.  At that time, it was running Wear OS which worked perfectly.  Then Fossil came out with their own software, and I made the mistake of ""upgrading."" Unfortunately, I ignored the warnings that there was no way to go back, and ""upgraded"" anyway.  The watch went from all functions working perfectly to, in short, a piece of junk.  After installing the Fossil software, all of the functions that they left in place, work occasionally at best.  Very unreliable.  Notifications are unreliable. Watch doesn't lock when you take it off.  Constantly loses connection with the phone.  I could go on and on. Fossil took what was a great watch and ruined it."
Luis Ramirez,"The Fossil Gen 6 watch is a great Wear OS watch. Easy to use, smooth operation, and very versatile. This is my 8th smart watch in many years and this one is the best. Sadly, the downfall is the screen will scratch pretty easily. I was recently taking down an artificial Christmas tree and reaching into the center of the tree, to reach a connector, scratched my watch screen in several places. Think about an artificial tree...it's made of plastic ""pine tree needles"". So, in reality the plastic, flexible ""pine tree needles"" scratched the ""Gorilla Glass"" on the front of a $200 watch. That is very disappointing."
SEAPanks,Love the ability to make/answer calls from my watch. Awesome downloadable faces like the fallout pipboy face.Only issue I've encountered would be the charging dock. I would like to see something more stable or secure.
Trevor R Decker,"So far everything works well. Battery life seems good but i have it on battery saver. Charging is quick, 30 minutes gets you to 100%. I charge it in the morning and wake up the next day with 30 to 40% of the battery left. My usage is moderate."
Mark Testa,"I've had a Fossil Q Explorist for a few years and was worried after reading reviews that this was going to have a worse battery life. I took a chance and ordered, and after almost a month of wearing it every day, I can assure you, the battery life is much better than previous version! I will admit, the first day, the battery life was horrible, but after setting up what sensors were actually needed, the battery life hasn't been an issue. I've been able to wear it for two to three days straight on one charge.There are many improvements from my previous watch, and so far, I haven't found anything to complain about. I definitely feel as if this is a much needed upgrade."
E46Envy,"I really wanted to love this watch.  I have been a Fossil fan since the early 1990's but I am kind of ashamed of what Fossil brought to the table with this one.  There are ways to ""Extend"" the life of the battery but shutting everything off just to save some life on the battery doesn't make this a very ""Smart"" watch... it's actually pretty stupid since shutting all the smartwatch features off to save some power makes it useless!MY FIRST TEST:  I left for a bike ride just this weekend with a 100% charge on my watch and was excited to track my ride and maybe listen to some music.  I started my Strava app to track my ride and by the time I got 2 hours in (not using ANY other app... no music, phone, nothing else was running), the battery was already prompting to change to ""Battery Extend Mode"" because it was down to 20%!!I hate to be the one to say this... ESPECIALLY for the price tag... this watch is little more than a battery-powered bracelet.  I am forced to give up my life-long support to Fossil and switch to something else. Avoid this one folks... it was designed and engineered by idiots."
Juanita Landry,They got it right. Everything I didn't like about other models is pretty much gone. This would get all 5 stars if the Bluetooth didn't interrupt phone calls on the handset try to override to answer on the watch. We'll what future releases bring. So far this is worth upgrading (previous one was seriously damaged). Sleep tracking is great! And best battery life!
Juanita Landry,"I like this watch except for the battery life. You have to disable most features to get a day or so from the battery. Took me a week to dial it in to get about 14 hours. You need to turn off continuous and background heart rate, always on screen, wifi, and some other stuff. I manually start and stop my workouts and it still tracks the heart rate for each workout. The phone and messages work well, but could be louder. I turned off the battery saver because it kept changing other settings. You really have to tweak this alot , it's definitely not plug and play ."
Robert McReynolds,"I like the way it looks and enjoy many of it's functions. What I don't like is it constantly disconnects from my phone and I have to restart it to reconnect and get my notifications. The custom watch face keeps reverting back to default multiple times per day and I can't figure out why. But, it tells time! Tracks my steps, and I like getting my phone notifications even when my phone is in another room. I don't have issues with the battery, it makes it through the day and I charge it overnight."
Brett,"This is a fun and exciting device that you will soon forget, because it's pointless. The design is very contemporary and the style quite pleasing. Other than that, it's useless. As a daily wear watch, it's limited battery power is irritating unless you set it to only display the face when you touch it... which it will randomly turn itself back to always on and drain the battery. You will discover this when it is drained. It has very little purpose other than to ding, bleep, bloop, chime and Buzz to every dumb app that pushes notifications to irritating levels that are hard to disable. My choice was to put it permanently on slient to stop the madness. Defeating any point to notifications. This watch may be fine for those that only receive a few emails a day. You will always accidentally activate the stopwatch feature... I find it on all the time, randomly timing some imaginary race. The apps for tracking activities, sleep and fitness are intrusive and obnoxious. Great only if you want to share that data with every corporation on the planet. The software and firmware are just under developed and not really ready for Prime time. The Fossil is a fun gadget for a couple of days when it's new and exciting... until you realize it doesn't really do anything important... and that it's not very good at being a watch on it's own. This device will constantly and randomly restart on its own.... Notification?! No, just restarting because...reasons. This smart watch has trouble just being on. The battery on my Casio lasted 12 years... this will struggle for 12 hours with any of the features enabled. Don't buy this smart watch unless you want a technological novelty that annoys you constantly."
C. Collins,"Although this is a well designed smart watch with every feature I could hope for, the battery suck raw sewage. Having notifications for email, text and my calendar appointments on as well as steps, heartbeat and oxygen level. I need to charge this watch 2-3x a day. Why have all these feature if the battery can't handle it?? Just doesn't make sense.Another minor gripe: All the watch faces, either native to the watch or downloaded, does not cover the entire screen. There is about a millimeter black border around the bezel. Kind of annoyingGiven the amount of times I charge this thing, I can predict the life of the battery will more than likely on last only a year."
Quaxo,"First the good. The watch looks great and fits well. I prefer leather bands but the silicon band that came with the watch I purchased looked decent and was easy to adjust. The watch software operated smoothly, taking advantage of a decent processor and more memory. It felt much faster than the earlier Gen4 I owned.Now the bad: the accuracy of the step counting seemed way off, giving me credit for hundreds, if not thousands more steps than I actually walked. I also noticed when charging the watch that it would get extremely hot... I expected it would get warm, but this was beyond that. Looking at posts on user forums I found this was a common issue that could be ""fixed"" by turning off bluetooth before putting the watch on the charger. This did, in fact, prevent the overheating but it was just one more ""nail in the coffin"", so to speak.I expect/hope that these issues can be addressed with a future software update, but given the price of the watch and the unpredictability of when/if a future software update will arrive to fix these shortcomings, I chose to return the watch while I still could."
Joshua D Daggs,"I bought the watch specifically to track my sleep and vitals.  It does great in that regards, and it seems to be pretty accurate with sleep tracking (if not a little slow to figure out I've fallen asleep).  My biggest gripe is the battery life.  By default, it's abysmally low, but you can tweak the settings to get it reasonable.  My real issue is the inconsistency once you do change the settings.  Sometimes I can get 36 hours on a single charge, but the past couple days I've only been getting about 6 hours.  I'll charge right before bed, and it goes to battery saving mode in the middle of the night.  It'd be nice if I could see what is eating up the battery, but so far I haven't seen that as an option anywhere.  Charging speed is great, so if I had to charge every 12 to 24 hours that'd be totally fine, but when I put the watch on at 6 and here it's noon and I'm down to 25% battery and I haven't gone anywhere or done anything with the watch, it's a real let down."
Grayling Manson,"This watch is gorgeous, however it's lacking in many ways. The battery life is okay, nothing special. If you turn on the extended battery mode, which disables all fitness tracking, raise to wake, and AOD, it'll last you about 2-3 days. With all the features on, however, you'll be lucky to get 1 day out of it.I was told that this watch was supposed to ship with WearOS 3 installed, but mine came with 2.something. I thought no big deal, I'll just look for a software update. Sure enough, there was one! It brought me to WearOS 2.4. I never got any other updates.Haptics are alright. Vibrations are easy to feel, even if they are a bit loose. The rotating crown is great, but not all apps can take full advantage of it. I couldn't even use it on the main hello screen you get when you're first setting up the watch. It charges really fast, if you can get it to charge.I have nothing else good to say about this watch. The band that I got (silicone/leather) is some booty, and that was the best option. The pushers at the 2 and 4 o'clock positions are inconsistent at best. Charging this thing hardly works. You have to get the charger JUST right and make sure the watch doesn't ever move while charging. I also noticed mine making a high-pitched squeal while it was charging, which was sort of alarming. Battery life is only acceptable if you disable like 60% of the watch's functionality.For this price, I'd either wait for a good sale or go with a different watch entirely. I returned this Fossil; now I've got a Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra (quite a mouthful, I know) and it's been great."
Beachman59,The look and the features are so good !!!
M. Pritchard,"This watch is a well designed smart device. Not a Dick Tracy wrist radio, but a convenient tool for keeping up with my messages and calls I want to answer. It is also very beautiful."
Shock System,"Battery dies fast, I receive 30-50 calls a day watch is set on extended, Bluetooth only, vibrate only, 5 sec screen time and double tap to turn on. My $45 smart watch last 5 days with out charging on its highest settings. I take this off the charger at 7am and lucky if it lasts till 4pm."
Al T,"I broke my fossil 5 after 3-4 years of use, and I decided I would upgrade to the fossil 6. Battery life is much better than the 5,"
Richard M. Quist,"Always on the road so took about a week for everything to be functional. Battery is comparable to others, have to charge everyday. Touchscreen worksfabulously. There was a learning curve for me, but it is intuitive."
N. Cigic,"I've been on a bit of a quest to find an alternative to many of the common smart watches.I've tried several over the past month and this one got closest to being ""the one"".The primary reasons I did not go with this watch were the non specific waterproof information supplied from Fossil and connectivity issues between the watch and my phone.Pros:-battery appears to be even better than indicated-very fast charging, <45 minutes from 10% to full.-very comfortable silicone band-easy to maneuver watch interface-GPay compatibility-clean, attractive minimalistic styling-Easy set up-surprisingly good speaker/mic-Great display quality-non proprietary app software-fairly low cost compared to similar watches-very easy to factory resetCons:-information from Fossil as to actual water resistance is lacking-intermittent disconnects from watch and phone with no clear factors as to whyOverall I think this is a great watch for the price, but it just did not meet my needs/requirements."
Sam Whitehead,Hate that I can't get more apps from play store than what I have
Ss,For the price it is a good deal. Not as nice as a Apple Watch. But a lot cheaper
C. Collins,"Not for you if you're wanting something comparable to Samsung or Apple. I have the full stainless steel version so it's heavy and feels good on my wrist, that's about it. As far as user experience goes, I've had a problem with settings (Bluetooth, always on display, sound, etc.) toggling themselves on/off. Maybe a syncing issue..? Whatever the problem is, this basically kills the rest of the experience for me. Makes it feel like I may as well have a generic $50 smartwatch. Just glad I got it during black Friday."
Quaxo,"Came from a Fossil Gen 4 Sport (and before that Ticwatch 2, TicWatch1, Asus ZenWatch).  After having battery life issues on the Sport, figured I'd try the Gen 6.  So far, much more responsive that the Sport, and the battery life is very impressive - using it for sleep tracking as well so on my wrist for 23 hours a day, yet not getting below 22%.  Then it recharges to 100% in 30-40 mins.  So that part's great.With regards to the silicone band (black), looks and feels great, but seems to be giving me a rash - yet only from the shorter of the 2 straps - and never had an issue with the silicone band on the Sport so not clue what's going on.  Getting a replacement cloth band, hopefully will take care of it."
Robert E. Bottomley Jr.,"Received the item ahead of time, well packaged, and in good condition. The smartwatch works well."
Tommy Crawford,Ordered for grandson. Very happy with purchase
Keith Peterson,"The watch is fantastic. It syncs with my Google Pixel 5 with zero issues. When you first load it up, I suggest going through the watch app on your phone. It turns on ever app you sync over. That's probably why the battery life is rough. Also, if you leave heart monitor on, your battery drains pretty quick. That is the one down size. However, mine goes about 2 days cause I have health monitoring off. If and when turned on, it gives me about 20 hours. Wish it had better life span, but it doesn't take away from the watches capabilities. My favorite is that my watch can act as my phone within Bluetooth range and I don't have to worry about paying for a plan on it."
Jay Hemphill,"I really like this watch.  It looks nice and is comfortable.  The battery just last the day for me, but since it recharges so quickly it's not a major problem.  I do look forward to the update to wear 3."
Jay Hemphill,"I get compliments on it from men and women. Very stylish, works well with my iPhone and idiot proof. I’m not tech savvy but I’ve managed to figure out how to use it easily. It is heavy and I had to get a couple kinks taken out. It’s perfect for me. I will definitely stick with fossil watches."
D. W. Balcom,"This watch is very sensitive. If the temperature gets above room temp it throws a ""high temperature"" error. If it sits on the charger it's gives you a high temperature error. I have sat outside and gotten the high temperature error. Literally just sitting there. I know it can get hot in the Texas Gulf Coast but this watch can't handle sitting in the shade it Texas."
Travis Mcgill,Great smart watch & wears fashionably.  Only con so far is screen time is too short
Richard Boyd,"This is my 3rd Fossil smart watch, and my 5th smart watch over all.  Fossils are the best!"
Antonio,Great watch. Very poor battery life
Leysath,"This is my fourth smart watch and by far the best I have owned. Compared to my last watch which was the Fossil Gen 4 this is much faster and I'm happy with the battery life. With everything turned on I get a day and a half to two days, I recharge the watch normally in the evening so I can wear it to bed for the sleep tracking. This watch charges extremely fast, I just put it on the charger and when I think about it again it's already charged. I'm very pleased with the Fossil Gen 6."
Ariel,I like that
Ariel,"I bought this to replace my gen 3 that finally quit working after several years. I use it primarily to stay on top of my notifications while my phone is in my pocket or recharging, but it is a good-looking watch and the dial is easy to customize for whatever first-glance information you like."
C. Collins,"Poor battery life.  Charger points are finicky and on a full charge with minimal use i can barely get through an 8 hour workday before its dead.  Sometimes it quits charging around 80% for some reason.  I like the watch, im just dissapointed the battery life is so short."
Quaxo,"I absolutely wanted this watch to be great. I used to wear Fossil watches all the time when I was younger, but I'm now Team Smartwatch. When I saw Fossil had one and it was on sale, I jumped at it. It looks like a Fossil watch, I love it. The screen is beautiful to look at, and I'm an Android/Google guy. But, the battery is woeful. I have a lot of features turned off, and it STILL barely makes it through a full day, and sometimes not even that. I get lots of messages throughout the day, and yes I know notifications drain the battery, but I'm an adult and work a lot, it's going to happen. Unfortunately, I only wear it when I want to look a little more stylish, which is once every week or two now, and I still grumble when it's dying at the end of the day."
Sondra Lubas,"Features ok if you want less than exact distance measuring, I like the sleep tracking, o2 level and heart rate.The band (smoked stainless) is the worst I ever wore. Pinches, bites , pulls hair. After 6 months the clasp is worn out and won't stay shut.Just ordered a replacement from fossil. Silicone instead of stainless, 40$.This will ruin the appearance but hopefully allow the endless skin pinches to heal."
Joshua Stewart,"Update: after about 12 weeks, purchasing this watch has been a total waste of time and money. The watch now overheats every time I charge it, some days the battery is completely drained in two hours, the touchscreen continues to be unresponsive at times, making the watch unavailable for 1-2 days waiting for the battery to drain, then recharge. I really wasted $350 on this watch. I should have followed my gut in the first week and returned this watch, but I thought things would get better. Every couple of weeks, while hooked up to the charger, the charging stops at around 77% and will not go any higher. Some of those times the watch gets very hot, hot to the touch. Other times, as is happening right now, the touch screen is unresponsive. The watch will continue to keep time but nothing else can be used where the touch screen is involved. Even restarting the watch is impossible since tapping ""restart"" will not work. The only remedy that I have found is to let the battery drain completely then recharge it.For a highly rated smart watch, I wish I had gone a different direction while picking one out. For what it's worth, my wife ordered a women's version of the same brand, and she has had no problems whatsoever."
rb22,"I really don't like a few things about this thing, but it's handy for being a watch, providing fitness data, and keeping track of notifications.1. The battery could last longer, but that's an eternal problem I guess2. A while ago they decided for me that I was going to use Alexa instead of Google Assistant, which never worked well anyways, eitherway I never consented to changing to Alexa3. Updating the watch will cause it to lose all my settings, so I haven't done it"
Jennie,It runs super smoothly.
Jose T.,The watch itself is great. I like being able to download music to the watch and listening to it with headphones. You won't need your phone on a jog.The battery is terrible after a month or so. Don't leave on wifi because in 4 hours you will need to recharge again. Even just leaving on the location drains the battery quickly. The extended mode really lasts a day when it claims a few days between charges.I don't think I would recommend it because the battery.
Donald H.,"Bought this because I like Fossil watches. It is comparable with iPhones but you’re better off spending the money and getting an Apple Watch. If you do buy this watch, buy an extra strap, the one it comes with won’t last long before the notches start to crack."
Alexander Arnold,"I had a Gen 5 for several years, when it started to develop a few problems, I went for the Gen 6. I love this watch! Easy connection to my iSO. I really like ability to pay with it, and the health stats. Haven’t received a call on it yet. I do have to charge it every day, but I have a lot of goodie’s running. It charges fast anyway, so that’s not a problem"
Barry,The only issue is battery. It does have w time only more that last days and days.  After owning it fir a week I get about a day and s half of battery life. When I first got it I only would get ¾day.  Other than that I love this watch I can even talk on the phone with it like double oh seven.
mward100,"I've had a few android watches and thus one hands down has been the absolute best!! It disbursement Freeze up like precious watches did a lot, it's very responsive to touch and learning how to use was pretty simple."
Amazon Customer,I bought this one with the hope that fossil has made some improvements to their smart watch line up. I have used the gen 2 and gen 3 versions for a while and the gen 6 features are much better but the battery feels so much worse. With AOD and TTY off I wouldn't get more than 14hrs of battery. The capabilities of 4100+ chipset has not be utilized by this watch and I am very disappointed. I returned it and will not buy another fossil watch until they significantly improve battery life.
Amazon Customer,Why isn't there another way to charge this watch so that you don't have to always have the charger because it's going to run out of charge every few hours I've lost the specific charger for that watch so I can't charge it any other way it's a pain in the ass and not worth the money.  If it held charge for 8 hours it would be a different story but it doesn't not even close
C. Collins,Great battery life !….
Quaxo,I love my watch but honestly I hate it too. I love the design and the built quality. I hate that you can charge the battery to 100% and as soon as you unplug the watch it’s already at 99 and the consumption just plummets from there. I hate that it heats up terribly when downloading apps which causes the watch to go into extended mode on the battery. I’m sad that they promote partnership with Alexa but it isn’t available (coming soon). It is a nice looking piece with ALOT of flaws.
Jeremy Freed,Muchos problemas para conectar con mi iPhone 14 pro max. Lo regrese
Drew Weyer,"The FOSSIL app it not good, I would use WEAR OS instead.  Battery Life so far, meh. I can't believe FOSSIL cant design a better app.  The watch constantly is disconnecting from my phone.  Also had to update the watch recently. FYI when you do that its like adding a brand new watch back to your phone, really? Again use wear OS not the FOSSIL app, but since the new update I dont have a choice so I have to use the FOSSIL app, so.... do better FOSSIL!  I debating returning it, but i got a heck of a deal on it, so ill give it another week."
David Poeppelmeier Jr.,It replaces an older Garmin. it's So much better than the Garmin there's no comparison.
Roger VanCuren,"Had the watch for over a month before writing a review. In the first few days of wearing it I immediately noticed the screen tends to freeze ALOT. No tapping or clicking the buttons helps. Sometime the screen would return to normal on its own after a few minutes but a few times I needed to do a force restart - all within a mere 5 weeks of owning it.Another big problem is the Bluetooth connection. The connection between my iPhone and the watch clearly disrupts my phone’s ability to connect to other devices. When connected to the watch, my phone could not connect to either mine or my wife’s cars where I always used it. Even my son’s toy Jeep’s Bluetooth radio could not connect to my phone with the watch connected.Then there’s the app, which has to be open all the time in the background on your phone. If you close the app, the Bluetooth connection fails. Then, in order to answer calls on the watch you need to be connect two different ways…once through the Wear OS app and a second connection has to be made through your actual Bluetooth settings in your phone.Lastly, in order for the phone to show text message previews on the screen, you need to turn on text previews on your phone which means anyone can read your text messages on your phone Home Screen even when it’s locked.Over all,  wry annoying glitches between the screen freezing all the time, the horrible Bluetooth connection issues, and disappointing text capability, after 5 weeks I had enough and decided to return it."
Kindle Customer,Still getting everything figured out on it but so far it seems to be exactly what I was expecting.
Aeri,"I was really excited to get this. After wearing a Fitbit Ionic for 3 years I wanted something a bit more business casual. My Fitbit could go a week between charges. The battery life is a deal breaker. Some days I can go 12 hours with the fossil and some days I only get 6-7 hours use. I view emails, texts and other notifications but nothing more than my old watch. I’ve had it to long to return it so I’m stuck with it for a bit but I’m looking forward finding something better."
Jose J Rodriguez,"Almost everything about this watch is perfect. The display is great, build quality is some of the best, charging is fast, and performance is great. Great. But for me none of that really matters if I can't get through a day without it dying on me. If I put it on at 8:00 in the morning, then it would probably be dead by 4:00 p.m. if the watch could last two days then I would have given it five stars easily. I recommend if you need a decent battery life then go with the ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra. That's what I've switched to and it's been basically perfect for me."
Mike S,Not a good battery life. It dies in around 5 hours max and that’s nit good compare to other smart watches
Patrick,I loved the watch and the fact that it was pure Wear OS. It was a very good looking watch as well and actually had a little weight to it. The charging method in this watch is awful and needs to change. I had it a couple weeks and I could never get it to charge properly. I would place it on the charger at night and wake up to a hot watch that was not charged. $300 for a watch I expect better. All the big companies went with wireless charging years ago what the hell Fossil.I returned it and now will wait for the Pixel watch to be released.
Amazon Customer,No mad with this at all!
C. Collins,The battery life fluctuates on how many apps you have running but for the basic watch and basic apps that you use like heart monitoring text message emails the watch will last about 8 hours of constant use and about 12 hours of regular use.
Quaxo,Got this for my 16 teen yr old son and he loves it. It's well worth the money. Dose so much stuff.
john,"I loved the look of the Fossil watches and bought one for my husband as wel, BUT  I will.never buy another fossil watch again!- the battery dies so fast I leave for work at 7 and it's dead my 12!- my watch just completely died it won't charge or anything just back screen- same for my husband watchI contacted customer support and they said there is nothing I they can do because it's been over 1 year! It hasn't even been 2 years! I am furious. They told me I can send it in to be fixed and they would send me a bill. Stick with Samsung! Dont buy this watch!"
Jeremy,"I upgraded from a Gen5 and I was pretty excited with knowing they fixed the charging coils falling off issue with the Gen5 as well as the fact that this is running on the latest Snapdragon chip set that will support WearOS 3 eventually but after 3 weeks of usage I ended up returning it. I loved how the watch looked and how it worked but the problems I had were with charging and some software issues. The watch gets really really hot when charging and it couldn't charge all the way to 100%, it was basically charging from 5-10% to 35% then I had to unplug it and plug it again to get it to go up to 70% and then again to get it to charge to 100% but as I said it was getting super hot every time so you couldn't wear the watch right away after charging. On the software side of things it was forgetting the settings every couple days, I had to again go into the settings and set the wrist wake-up or the touch wake up to off."
Manu Suresh,"After voice typing a text when you hit send it says not allowed, same with calls. I did all the suggested actions and still not allowed. I went online to tech support pages and this problem has existed since the watch came out with no fix yet."
G Rock,"So far I am impressed. The 4100+ is a noticeable upgrade with app responsiveness and snappiness. The battery life is biggest difference though. I have my battery preference set with Bluetooth, gps, touch to wake, and tilt to wake on: And with a lot of use I still have 70% battery after 4 1/2 hours. This watch is great and will only get better when Wear OS 3 drops early next year.***First week of use: So far, still very happy. Battery lasted 26 hours and just hit 10%. A great improvement from the Gen 5."
Jeff sexton,"I watched 100 reviews of every smart watch and was sure that I was making the right choice with the Fossil. Nope. The fit was very finicky. You can remove links, and then you have three holes on the clasp to fine tune it. The right fit for me was exactly at the point where taking out one link and putting it at the tightest hole was too loose, but taking out 2 links and using the loosest hole was too tight. I realize I won the bad luck lottery on that one, but someone else may also.Sometimes after charging the watch would be hot - not leave a mark hot, but definitely way hotter than it should be hot. Other times it wouldn't even get the slightest bit warm. In the week I had it, I did nothing on it besides look at the time and I never got more than 10 hours out of a charge. I didn't utilize any kind of always on display - it was set up for whatever the Google wear OS default settings are, which apparently don't include being notified of phone calls or text messages - because they didn't come through. If I swiped to check notifications, the texts would be there, but nothing ever popped up when a text or call came in. It's a nice looking watch, but if you want to actually use it and have it last more than 10 hours, get something else - I am."
Vicente Carrillo,Cumple con mis expectativas
arianni,It is not iPhone compatible and I have been waiting for my refund. Was told that it was received by Amazon on the 24th but still haven't gotten my money back
Matthew Seiman,"Absolutely love this fossil smart watch. Has all the features I was hoping for. Easy charging, and holds a charge for a good amount of time in my opinion. The center button is a little more sensitive than I would like. Sort of easy to push the center button in if you bend your wrist a certain way, but that is remedied by adjusting it's function in settings."
Ken,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I bought it on Feb 9th. Today while I was charging it, the screen burnt. I contacted Fossil and they refused to replace it. So, I contacted amazon and the agent was really helpful and got someone into the call with us. The guy said we will do a repair claim but they would replace it instead - not sure yet as he seemed inexperienced, he did my address phone number and everything wrong when he sent me the shipping label and the file didn't indicate any replacement."
Michal,"Nice layout sturdy construction a bit on the expensive side but still a nice watch wish it was a little bit easier to navigate takes some getting used too, battery life could be better but it does charge fast Wear OS needs an update make sure apps are up to date and for best experience."
C. Collins,"This is my 3rd smartwatch and I love it. I read plenty of reviews before I purchased it, many complained about short battery life, but one reviewer mentioned that if you turn off the WiFi it helps. It does, infinitely. I get about 28 to 36 hours from a charge, which works well for me.Otherwise, I like the UI, it's a handsome watch. Couldn't be happier."
Quaxo,Definite improvement over the Gen 5 improved battery power which gives you more options throughout the day. Could use more faces. Seems they deleted a lot of them.
GDub,"Google Assistant is not perfecton WearOS 2, but does many things well.  It pairs nicely with Google Keep for lists and notes."
Tina Dean,My nephew bought this device and he loves it. it works prefect.
Jason Wiltjer,"I ordered this thinking that it would be great being a fossil and reading the reviews and stuff.  However, I am considering returning it.  I am definitely not happy with the length of the battery charge.  Plus its not easy to just add a picture as ur background.  It is not very user friendly.  So I am going to give it till the end of the week and see.  However, I am leaning towards returning it."
Jeel Patel,I love the watch I think it looks great. But at the time I wrote this it still have the old version of wear OS and its absolutely garage.
Don,"This is probably the most I have ever spent for a watch, but the features and quality seem to be worth it. I am still learning my way around the watch but have noticed and appreciate the long battery life"
TrexShortArmKiller ,A reasonable attempt at form and function. Misses the mark though.  Slow processor and a screen that is not very responsive lead to a sometimes frustrating experience.  The included “Fossil” faces do little to represent the fashion of the brand. It’s like they bought a setup and then contracted with google for the support.  It’s less of a proud purchase and more of a so so get by device.  While it’s not bad enough to warrant a return I would be hard pressed to buy another watch from Fossil
jimmylee,Pesimo para un IPhone muy pocas las funciones aclaro si es compatible pero con funciones al mínimo a diferencia que con un teléfono android es compatible al 100% en general el reloj esta Bien
Chris,"I like the watch. The battery life is unpredictable- one day it does on me and the next it has 50% left when I charge at night. The charger that came with it already went bad and I've had it less than two months. Also, I feel like I swipe a different way each time to get things to pop up. I still can't figure it out. And I'm pretty comfortable with technology."
Milagro,"Reboots at least 4 times an hour so I'm lucky if I get 8 hours out of a charge, to point now where I don't even wear it anymore."
Emilio Sanchez,"Low battery life, Sensor constantly goes out during workouts so you don't know what your BPM is, and the sleep function is hit or miss (sometimes you'll get a reading in the morning .. sometimes its like you were not even wearing it through the night).  Going back to fitbit."
C. Collins,                    The media could not be loaded.                 A very elegant watch that takes time to be appreciated. In the beginning I found difficulties managing an Google OS with an apple phone but as I’ve gone about my exploration within the device I’m somewhat loving it. I rate it an 8/10 product if you’re someone that’s keen on advancing with technology.Note: I had issues connecting to the fossil app but Google’s Wear OS works perfectly.
Quaxo,the fossil watch didn't compatible with iphone.1-calls can't be answered through the iphone.2-high temperature detected always happen.3-updates cause heats of watch.4-messages can't be answered through the iphone.
Stitcher,
Matthew,"Although Not Perfect By Any Means, I Feel The Fossil Gen 6 Is An Upgrade From My Gen 5 Carslye.  The Battery Life Though Improved Still Could Be Better.  I Do Like However The Slightly Larger Bezel On The Watch Face Over The Gen 5.  The Google Fit Features Are A Little Better As Well On This Gen 6.  Overall, No Regrets..."
Matthew,I love my watch! Everything I wanted!If you read that it overheats while charging it's because the watch updates while charging. Only overheated once while it was on the charger and that was the first night. After that it's been perfect
wowarning,"So, in fairness, it is a good Android watch given those base features.  Anyone thinking of using this as a fitness or exercise watch, buy something different.  It can only read the pulse ox (blood oxygen) reading if you hold perfectly still for 15-25 seconds so it won't work if you're working out or if you move at all.  The pulse reading is very inaccurate, it said my pulse rate during workout was 95 bpm.  My finger pulse ox (which WILL read a level while you exercise) said my heart rate was 132 bpm at the same time.  The sleep tracker doesn't report three levels of sleep, it reports two, which don't match up to any of the published sleep tracking measurement modes.  It's supposed to be in line for a software update soon, that may or may not fix the issues I'm having.  One can hope."
diego lozano sanchez,"No complaints at all, worth the money in my opinion."
diego lozano sanchez,"If you upgrade to WearOS 3, the watch requires the use of the Fossil app rather than just Google WearOS.  This requires an account with Fossil to sync your biometric data with Fossil.  You can't opt out or downgrade after installing WearOS 3.  The biometric tracking only works with the Fossil cloud and if you don't use the fitness apps, the watch sends you periodic notifications to sync your biometric data.The Fossil app also sends you periodic notifications about watch faces you've ""unlocked"" or other Fossil notifications.  Overall, I like the watch, but loathe the Fossil app.  The app ruins the user experience and is enough to make me look for a different watch.If you buy this watch, don't upgrade to WearOS 3 unless you want to be bound to the Fossil app and unable to use the regular Google WearOS app by itself."
Ande',"The watch looks nice, but the battery wouldn't last a work day. I turned a lot of auto stuff off and about 12 hours later it wanted me to go into battery saving mode. Also the screen is small. Its gorgeous but small. The Galaxy 4 (With latest update) can last over 24 hours and has a 1.4"" screen where the Fossil has a 1.28. The Ticwatch Pro or Samsung Galaxy 4 are much better choices (Have both)"
Lewis Ward,"Ok so to start, I love this watch. It's very good quality. A good weight, the classic watch feel, and it's comfortable to wear. The apps work great and it dose indeed have a full functioning key board. I would recommend to anybody. Great watch"
Mohamed A.,"Ordered this on Nov 26th and it arrived on the 27th! STOKED! I'm familiar with Wear OS and Fossil so set up was as expected, but much faster then previous versions. First few days I took the watch off at 40 to 47% charge and the next morning topped off for a full charge before starting off my day. Yesterday I let the charge go down to about 20% and when I charged it, I noticed it was going beyond 52% and it was almost too hot to touch. Let it cool down for an hour and tried charging again. Got about 54% and started getting hot. Ended up taking 3 hrs to get in the 90% charge range due to often stopping the charge because of the heat. Heat is NOT good for these batteries. I have seen a post or two on Reddit about this and I have opened a support ticket with Fossil."
Mohamed A.,Not Bad!
William W.,I really liked this watch until this week when it stopped keeping track of my steps. Every day I have to re install everything and do a complete reset. I'm at the point where I'm just going to toss it in the trash and take a loss. Very disappointed I waisted my money should have spent a little more And got something different . Live and learn I guess...
Garret,Takes time to understand the protocols. Still working with it
PETER SHIVELL,Works really great. Connects to phone super fast. Came with charger which charges the watch super fast. And its features are great and come in handy. Even changing the watch faces is great. There are so many to choose from
C. Collins,It was good at first then the charger would only work sometimes or if you lay or place it a certain way I wouldn't by again
Quaxo,We like the features but the battery life is horrible! Have to charge it everyday.
Douglas Carlson,It's hard to charge without access to a computer port.
Ria Sookram,This will sink with your Apple phone getting better at knowing what I mainly use it for
Charles L.,"Everything works great, I would like a longer lasting battery!"
Brandon Jolly,"UPDATE: Refunded because of its many bugs and terrible battery life.bought this to replace my galaxy watch and damn its got so many issues i thought would have been worked out by now by watch devs let alone fossil brand.issues so far-1.battery life, thing don't last the day, like 7 hours with nfc turned off and tacking turned off.2.adjusting the watch band takes tools i don't have so good thing i ordered other watch bands at purchase.3.gotta download apps to change watch faces and they want you to pay for more or most apps, max of 10 i think before you have to purchase a premium account to hold up to 20...wtf galaxy smoked them on this part the most.4.ignoring the very long setup and updates that seemed to have made the watch worse somehow the interface is extremely bad and poorly designed, getting around and setting things up is by far 200x worse then the galaxy watch i had.The good.1. the watch is made well with good metals and feels nice and looks nice but only time will tell how it holds up......thats it...nothing else is good about this watch."
Walt B.,The charger is like any other charge
Sean Morgan,I used it for a little over 2 months but it quit working. My last gen model still works after 2 years. I was told support for that model was ending so I upgraded. This new model is completely useless. Even with the new software the previous model apparently isn't compatible with it works no different than the old one. This model quit working while on the charger. And even after leaving it in the charger for 2 days it still dead. It has lived up to it's name and is a fossil
Flor,"Bought this watch to have for a little since my current Apple Watch 4 just doesn't hold charge anymore. This not only did not fix that problem, it was worse. Charged it up to 100% before a quick 4 hour shift, got done and it was at 60% after like, a few time checks and some notifications. Barely used it. How does it drop 40% of its battery after such minimal use. That was the worse case, but it was pretty consistent with the week I had this thing. Do not buy this thing I am warning you. It is really nice looking, gotta give props for the design, but the battery totally ruins it. Refunded and returned."
Andrea martin,Mixed reviews about battery life. I charged to 100% when setting up. It used about 65% battery over 16 hours the first day. Keep in mind wear os 2 is being run until the update later next year when battery life will improve better. It's a very high quality watch. It does what I wanted it to do and it does it well.
charles petty,"When u are in a fit workout mode or wellnessmode battery dies with in 2 hrs, if u are looking for little longer battery life dont go for this watch"
SR,"I work a 12 hour shift.  Only use this watch as a watch while on duty.  No texts, no music, screen dimmed, touch to turn on, no apps running whatsoever.  This watch does NOT make it thru a 12 hour shift even when everything is off.  Dont waste your money, especially if you want to utilize any of the features this watch is capable of doing.  Unless you bring a charger with you wherever you go.  The reviews of battery life are no joke.  The battery life on this watch is absolute garbage.  I start at 100% life at the beginning of my day.  12 hours in it is under 10% or just plain dead.  If i could return it....i would do so in a heartbeat!!  (Which this watch could monitor if it had a decent battery)."
C. Collins,"The watch is good for calls and notifications, however, the battery life is fair."
Quaxo,"Honestly, it’s a great price for what it is. It’s easy access and easy to connect to with your phone! It’s a perfect gift for him or for yourself! I bought it for my boyfriend and it really made an impact on him. We’re athletes, and this tracks almost to everything you need for sports and normal daily activities!"
Suhail Ashraf Bhaiyat,The design is attractive. Features are good. Works with Android and iOS. Battery can be improved.
Suhail Ashraf Bhaiyat,"Bought this to upgrade from my Gen 5. Unfortunately it feels the same in every way except worse in a few. There is no longer a double tap shortcut for google pay. You have to set it to one of the single tap function buttons. So you lose a shortcut there. Also, there is no support for double tap functions. There should be, but the gen 5 doesn't have it either. The double tap is a default function you can't change. But that is gone on the gen 6.Probably my biggest gripe through, is the pre-installed garbage software they put on. On Gen 5 it was only Fossil software installed. This one come bloated with facer, Nike and worst of all Alexa. There's more but you can uninstall them. Alexa you cannot, you can only diable it. Trash business practices. It's not 2005 annymore I don't want bloatware installed on my device that I can't uninstall. I'm sure they got a nice penny from Amazon for forcing the software on the watch. Double dipping trash. I'm most likely going to return it as it's actually worse than my gen 5.Sad, I'll most likely move on to another smartwatch brand after this. I don't appreciate the double dipping at my expense."
ahmed,Fossil fooled me twice so shame on me but at least this time I'm getting my money back. Last fossil because a brick the very moment the warranty expired...This one just doesn't work for example I have the phone for a week and a half and I had to pair it at least a dozen times. And the day before I returned it Fossil forced an update that completely brick this one too..Oh and the battery slightly better unless you use facer which of course takes the battery again so useless... And none of the included watch faces are simple elegant or easy to read.Oh and it won't show notifications for Google 2fa... It will for the Duo mobile app but not the Google 2fa WTF?
Juan Rodríguez,This is my second Fossil smartwatch and it has not disappointed me.
Juan Rodríguez,First smart watch and it's really nice
Timothy N.,"Bue producto, batería debe mejorar."
ken,Great watch!
Amazon Customer,"After day one, the watch battery was at 71%. That's after wearing it with all of its features on for 10 hours. Easy to setup and pairing with my Pixel 4 XL phone. Watch charges very fast as well. Had it on the charger and only took 15 mins to go from 71% to 100%! Very impressive"
Paul c,"I have most of the features turned off. My primary need is to track my sleep. This watch has a ton of features, so if you used everything thing it's capable of, it would be dead in less than a day. I would definitely buy another if I break this one"
Amazon Customer,"Esperaba un mejor desempeño, no evolucionó del 3 a la fecha en nada, la batería horrible y los sensores peor…"
Amazon Customer,"I always had a high expectations about Fossil smartwatches. They looked nice and always caught my eye. Well, Fossil 6 was delivered and the first impression, alright they look nice. Put it on the charger overnight after setting everything up and took it off the charger in the morning and put it on my wrist and got ready for work for about 30 minutes. Looked at the battery, 84%. 16% in 30 minutes. Excuse me! I have Samsung Active 2 and that thing gets on my wrist in the morning around 8am and when I get back home around 7:30pm, it always has around 54% battery left. I have Ticwatch 3 Pro and that thing comes back with 75%.And, supposedly, this Fossil Gen 6 has Snapdragon 4100 Plus chipset, yet my Ticwatch Pro 3 smokes this thing. This thing is very laggy, touch sensitivity has this delayed feel. This is not it. I am sorry, Fossil. It is not you, it is me. I just had too high of an expectation.Pros: Only one. Looks nice.Cons: The rest.Step it up, Fossil. If you are charging $300 for this, STEP IT UP! Please invest in your software team. Good luck! Not gonna buy your watches anymore. Thanks."
Colton,wish I hadn't bought it. The watch is difficult to operate. And customer service is terrible
Colton,I really like this watch. Easy to use and connect to my phone.
C. Collins,"The band itself is very big and in order to get links taken is very tedious, other then that my father loves it, he works in construction and it's a very durable watch he can wear to work."
Quaxo,Sometimes when I set the watch to charge it doesn't make good contact and ends up not charging. The metal strap makes it worse since the watch can't lay flat. I needed to 3d print a stand so I can effectively charge the watch. Other then the charging situation I think everything else works fine
David B.,"Battery life is less than desirable. Watch randomly restarts on its own. Factory updates are rarely accepted. Charger doesn't always recognize watch which further highlights/emphasizes my first point.  Have to continually reconnect watch to phone via Bluetooth or wifi. Other than that, some of the other features and tools are okay."
Rolando Jose Llorente Jr.,watch did not power on initially
Jason Jordan,"I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas in Dec. 2021.  Over the past few weeks, he said that it has been getting so hot while on the charger, it will actually burn you when you pick it up!  Now, when he has it on the charger, it heats up, charges to 100%, then begins discharging back down.  Clearly there is an issue with this watch recharge system, that borders on dangerous.  I've contacted Fossil, and am waiting for their support to call me back.  If they fail to resolve this issue, I will be heading to the BBB, and the FAA next.  My advice- keep looking for a better smart watch, and pass this one by."
R. Smith,"First off, I really like this watch. I wanted to love it, but the short battery life made me realize that would never happen. I either had to charge it in the evening after charging it in the morning, or turn features off to stretch the life to last until the next morning. Unfortunately I’ll be returning this watch."
steven perez,"So I should have stayed with Samsung.  Battery life is barely over 15 hours with everything turned off but the watch. The watch faces are Expensive, .99 cents to 2.49 per.  Was expecting a lot more from Fossil.  A big disappointment."
steven perez,Really enjoy the upgrade so the charger and the overall speed of the device cannot wait for the next Android update
Nana5327,"I've had the Gen 2 Fossil watch and the Gen 4 Fossil watch prior to this. Out of all three watches this by far has the least responsive screen, longest lag in button response and launching apps and WORST battery life. It also seems to have more problems losing its Bluetooth pairing with my phone. Overall this watch is a down grade from previous versions and I will definitely be switching to the pixel watch or a Samsung watch relatively soon. My days of being a fossil loyalist are officially over. Don't recommend"
Dawn Stinson,"First off, the watch is beautiful. It’s great looking and feels well made. Unfortunately it’s operating system leaves much to be desired. For the first few days it worked ALMOST perfectly. There would be some lag here and there, but nothing extreme. After about 5 days it’s almost stopped working completely. The screen would barely respond and the apps wouldn’t boot. The battery would be fully charged and yet it would say it’s about to die- although it would stay on for two days with use, so I’m assuming it just wasn’t registering a full battery? I don’t know man. This watch has so much promise but let me down in less than a week. Returned it and am now searching for another."
Billy Morris,Battery life goes kinda quick! And watch bands come in a large size only w/ no tool for adjusting 😔
Amazon Customer,"May not always charge due to overheating. Also display turns to ""always on"" even after turning off multiple times. Didn't have either issue with my fossil gen 5."
Amazon Customer,"Battery is OK, uses 70% in a day. Constantly asks to activate Google pay, which I don't need(annoying). Fitness is the main app. Looks good and not too heavy. Not much in the wow department and this gift was my second connected watch of this type."
C. Collins,"I bought this damn near $300 “smart watch” because I love fossil, and figured since it says it’s compatible with my phone, I’d give it a shot.  The Wear OS app, or whatever it’s called, is a joke. It never stays connected to the device. It says connect to Bluetooth, then says disconnect Bluetooth to connect through the app. The app never shows my watch, EVER, no matter how many “retry” buttons I hit.  I will be asking for a refund, and a way to ship this crap back."
Quaxo,"I wish you could add any app to tiles but you can only add from a preselected list, orger than that i love it. It's a small inconvenience you just have to go to the app list to choose the rest of your apps"
Lord Wood,"I purchase this watch on November 26, 2022. I loved it! It was wonderful. That is until January 11, 2023 when the watch just stopped working. Completely blank. It was on the charger overnight. I tried a hard reset, but nothing. I put it back on the charger. Still nothing. Luckily I am within the return range on Amazon so that is exactly what I am doing. I asked for a refund because I will not let them burn me again with a bad watch. I will just order a different one."
GORDON R CARTER,"Nice watch easy to use and awesome features, battery life is decent (based on how much you use it of course)Sometimes after 2 weeks of using ityou need to restart it because sometimes it glitches"
A buyer of things,"I was super excited to get this watch, but was immediately dismayed when I saw that this watch won't make it through a full day even with NFC, heart rate tracker, etc. all disabled. The selection of default watch faces are extremely lackluster, and the only watch faces that work are from Facer which you have to pay for—other watch faces on the Play market don't function properly. Another thing is that when the watch dies (as it often does because I can't get home to charge it even when putting it in smart battery mode), after it has been recharged, it seems to always disable bluetooth, so you have to go into settings to reenable it so that it can communicate with your phone. Another annoying thing is that when the watch dies and is charged back, the sound notifications turn back on, which is extremely annoying, especially while at work.Overall, I am not the slightest bit impressed by this product. I wish I had refunded it when I had the opportunity and gotten something else. This is ridiculous quality for the price. I would've expected better out of Fossil."
Amazon Customer,I bought this for my husband and he won't stop talking about it. He loves everything about it. Especially being able to talk into it if he doesn't have his phone nearby.I'd have to say it's the best Christmas present I've ever bought him.
Amazon Customer,"Best looking but here it is over. The watch gets very hot and drains the battery in 20-3- minutes a few times a day. When it doesn't happen even when I set the watch to medium battery usage which supposes to last more than a day doesn't last 24 hours and I didn't install any up, it is still like stock mode. Regarding the sleeping monitoring, not sure why but you can see how much time you were in deep sleep/REM/light, you need to assume it from the chart. bottom line, if most of the time the watch has no battery then all its looks and features are worth nothing."
Amazon Customer,
M. Helder,I put the watch on the charger around 4PM and checked it somewhere around 8AM and never displayed anything no matter what I did. The watch was just broke so I returned it on Feb 6 and it is Feb 26th now with no refund yet.
Dimitri Liburd,"You have to factor reset the watch all the time, the first one I bought arrived with no speaker for voice calls or music, now this. Please improve product would really like to buy next version of better, not an apple or Samsung fan. Hopeful, or trying to be optimistic that I just had a bad draw of luck twice. wish it had an external case like gen 5 has available, got a damaged bent power button from working but fixed it. Still works. Some improvements needed. Always disconnects and won't repair after a day or 2."
Cocoa,i liked the sleep tracking... it was very accurate...! the watch felt very comfortable and looked great...! i would charge the watch in the morning in the time it takes me to drink my coffee... i absolutely loved this watch....
Manoj Kumar Nannapaneni,"Long time Apple watch wearer, but this watch can be worn with a suit in the boardroom. App store definitely has some catching up to do in order to compete with Apple but when it comes to looks this watch wins hands down"
C. Collins,"Bought for my husband as a gift. He lives it and wears daily. The battery life is very good, the messages and sleep tracking all work excellent!  Very happy we picked this version of the Fossil Watch!!"
Quaxo,I have to give Amazon credit!After getting a brand new defective smart watch in the mail yesterday and mailing it back to them the same day-Amazon responding lightning quick!!They shipped me a replacement watch which I received today-a one day turn around!Thanks for the rapid service!!
Joe,"Do me a favor. Go to the fossil app on your device and read the reviews. It's hundreds of 1 star reviews. If you buy this watch you will have a useless paperweight. DO NOT BUY! The latest update from October destroyed the watch and its impossible to use. Your watch only works on the fossil app which crashes every 2 seconds. Seriously every 2 seconds. Obviously fossil has no idea how to fix the issues since it's been 2 months. Again, save your money and do not buy. Thank me later."
James,"AGAIN, I trusted fossil they would deliver  a REAL smartwatch, but again same I got from GEN5 I found again in GEN6Laggy OS, bad battery life, very very old version of wear os user interface I believe it does not have any smart features but only it has a touch screen which is very dim and laggy as wellITS ONLY STYLISH WATCH and this is the only pros it hasI WILL NEVER RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE AGAIN"
Tanya Rogers,Love this watch. This is the second one. Never any problems. It's a everyday life type of watch. Tried others just didn't feel the same. I'll purchase when this one stops. Would like to get my old one fixed.
J.D,"I replaced twice, and have the 3rd one right now.The first one was overheating at first charging, and I immediately returned.The 2nd one was OK at first charging, but it was again overheating at 2nd charging.In both cases, it was really overly heating and you might get skin-burn if you held long - that level of overheating.It seems a very common issue, and you can find the thread in reddit.I contacted Fossil Customer Service, who just request to claim replacement.All right, I got the 3rd one and we will see how it goes."
gmendez67,The watch stopped working this month - my husband has only had it for 5 months.
GrimReaper,"I purchase this 3 days ago. Immediately, i noticed that it didn't do the job of a watch I purchased for $30. I decided to try it out anyways. My thoughts, Just an expensive watch that disconnects Bluetooth while I'm sleeping. Battery life is 24hrs or less compare to the $30 that last up to 7 days without charging. As I'm writing this and the watch is next to me, the app and my watch is still trying to pair on my phone. Yes, imma going to refund this and get all my $$$$ back"
Dafuzz,"12 hr battery life. Google apps not ready for prime time.  Metal bracelet hard to reattach.  Silicone band to cut correctly.  Watch rotates to the left and ends up sideways on your wrist.Lots of functions, but difficult getting to the ones you really need."
Dave,It was a present for my husband.  He is not tech savvy so unfortunately I don't know how well everything works.  😔 I can say it is a beautiful watch!
Alberto Cuevas Aburto,"The 1st one I bought had to order a new one 3 hours later as if you do any research you will find that the watch gets VERY hot while charging and that's IF it even charges now that i have the 2nd one I am returning it a week later as it has developed the same problem it won't charge it gets VERY VERY HOT, I haven't downloaded any apps on it I don't stream music from it I use it as a watch and that's about it as when my phone rings I miss the call every time cause it is linked to my phone so my ringer on my phone doesn't make any noise and the watch is quiet and even in a dead silent room you can barely here it, the battery doesn't last even 1/4 of what they claim it to last im going back to the Samsung galaxy 4 watch it is MUCH better of a watch compared to this POS"
Bilguun Galbadrakh,My husband has been looking at this watch for a while. I got him the black stainless color. He has been spending a lot of time learning how to use it and absolutely loves it.
C. Collins,"excellent product, as described by the seller"
