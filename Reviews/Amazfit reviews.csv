JTC,"Upgraded as my previous sport watch tracked mileage on a run by the number of steps.  Run faster with a longer stride, and the distance was longer than if I ran slower with a shorter stride.  Having GPS built in solves that problem and I have found it to be pretty accurate and very consistent with this watch.  I also like the built-in storage for music, as I don't have to pull out my phone to change songs or volume, or even pause.  I also like being able to see text notifications and even incoming calls to see if they can be ignored until later while I'm on my phone. Actually, I'm using the feature more and more throughout the day, not just when working out.  The watch face I downloaded from them (Sporty Data) has all the info at a glance that I want- time, temp, heartrate, charge and number of steps.  I'm getting about 2 days on a charge, but my setup is pretty battery demanding - always on (by schedule for hours I'm normally awake) GPS during outdoor running and walking, using it as an MP3 connected by Bluetooth to my wireless earbuds, plus connected to the phone for calls, notifications, weather etc., and also monitoring steps and heart rate.  The app has a lot of features that I use and check regularly -heart rate, stress level & blood oxygen.  I also like the way it tracks my workouts so I can better manage my info from workout to workout.  Glad I spent more than originally planned and got this model vs some with less features."
Amy Rether,The fitness aspects of this watch are amazing. There's way too many to list but it does just about anything you'd need a fitness watch to do. GPS works well and you can go back and look at the map on your phone afterwards. I think the best function is the battery life. Seems to never need charged despite always be used (and my little ones pushing the buttons to light up the screen). My biggest complaint is the music feature. It's actually one of the main reasons why I picked the pro model. It showed Amazon music and Spotify as music companions but that's hardly the truth. I know it can't stream music through the watch but downloading a song onto it is impossible. Those apps don't let you actually download a song so how can I do so in order to move it to my watch? Pretty bummed about that.
ron2714,"They never respond on the Zepp App, I wish I had a choice."
Mark Woollacott,Todo muy bien y funcional
Kira Rebeaud,Satisfecho en lo personal...
Emilio Antonio Miguel Landestoy,I never write reviews but i had to for this one. I was an apple fanboy with an apple watch se before. this watch officially lasted 15 days on one charge with moderate to severe use. I used it for the workout apps as well as linked it to my apple health stuff and it worked just as well as an apple watch. I would only suggest you really go into which notifications you want from your phone so its not vibrating every 3 seconds and look through all the settings as you're charging it for the first time to really tune what you want the watch to do. also get a little screen protector if you're at all active.
JOALDY,The Watch is very nice but I want to use the bluetooh call feature and it was imposible.My phone and watch are connected but nothing happend when I try to make a call from the watch or the phone.
Giovanni Bustamante,"I had a very cheap smart watch and it was fine for a year or so. But then it started losing battery life. So I started looking for another, maybe with wireless charging. I stumbled upon this one and after reading the description, questions, and reviews multiple times, I decided to go for it. I was a little bit concerned about size, since the one I had was 40mm, but this thing is great! It has almost everything I wanted pre-installed (spO2, pedometer, always on display, read messages) it also has add on apps that have everything else. Even a great pong game!So it's definitely worth a try. Just do it. üòÅ"
Ricardo R,"This is a great watch for the price. It does everything as advertised. Clear, large display and though it doesn't come with much instruction, the operating system is very intuitive. Very good product."
Kindle Customer,"I saw many positive reviews and was looking for a smartwatch with a good battery life.  I was also looking for a ""smart"" smartwatch more than a fitness tracker.  This watch seems to have one foot on each side of that fence.The Good;Easy to sync with my Android phone.  Has a great battery life.  Looks good on my wrist.  Comfortable.  Alexa works great.  Has a nice selection of faces.  You can do almost everything from inside the phone app instead of having to use the watch to make setting adjustments.  You can answer phone calls right on the watch.  You can receive texts on the watch.The Bad;1-Doesn't sync with calendar.  I have the Samsung calendar on my phone normally but I also downloaded the Google calendar app.  Won't sync.  It has a calendar of it's own but doesn't sync with the one on your phone.  Apparently this is a known issue.  2- Can't reply to text messages.  You can see texts when they come in but you have to use your phone to reply.  Also can't send text messages, at all.  3- The phone app only lets you sync 50 contacts, total.  It only lists them alphabetically and doesn't allow a ""favorites at the top"" feature.  I also haven't gotten the watch to make a phone call using any of these synced contacts.  You can make a call by bringing up the dialer and inputting the number directly but at that point you might as well use the phone.Bottom Line.The only thing this watch does that watches $100 less don't do is answer phone calls.  I have a Ticwatch Pro 3 GPS that does everything this watch does plus sending texts, answering texts, and syncing with my calendar. Oh, and it cost me the same as this watch did. The battery only lasts for 2 days which is why I wanted to try out this watch but I'd rather charge once a day than lose those features. So I'll be returning this watch and hoping they can add those features at a later date."
Michael P,"--- Update: The amazfit support team reached out to me and found a workaround for setting up an account. I am updating my review from 1 star to 5. Thanks for the support.I never leave reviews, but these people have really pissed me off, and have taken a lot of my valuable time with no solutions.You'll need to go to hell and back if you need support on this product. I was excited to receive my watch this morning. I was trying to set up the app on my iphone in order to use the watch. But the app consistently crashes during the account setup prompts. Mind you, my iphone 13 is brand new with no issues. As such, I am not able to use the watch (no account on the Zepp app = no watch use).They have outsourced their support to amazon which can only help with generic issues that exist in the amazfit helpdesk found online. They simply share the most likely link with you that they think might be helpful. Its horrible. I was finally given an email to amazfit's support. They have yet to respond. Now I have a piece of good looking hardware that I cannot use."
Lynda S,"Muy buen producto, y buena compatibilidad con iOS."
JTC,"After trying out their older GTR2 I was specifically recommended from the manufacturer to upgrade to the GTR3 to get the features I needed.  But this model has several issues. First the watch face I had on my GTR2 isn't available on the GTR3.  Okay fine, I'll find something else. But to that point their claim of over 100 watch faces is not true, and most of the ones available are horrible and cheesy. I've yet to find a lock-screen watch face with a second hand, which the manufacturer said was there(and why I upgraded), but they can't tell me which ones and instead I've got the go through all the faces available on their store to find it? The new Zepp OS in this watch has several issues. Despite me setting the watch-face ""on"" time to 30 seconds, this doesn't happen. It will frequently turn off in about 3 seconds, very rarely does it stay on for 30 seconds. Probably the worst issue with this watch is when you turn on a workout mode the watch face disappears and and clicking the main crown button brings up a workout menu, not the watch face! The older GTR2 allowed this, pushing workout mode to the background so I could see more metrics with a watch face.  Sometimes an incoming notification will 'confuse' the OS and I'll get the watch face back, but  will usually end up stuck in the workout mode. Basically an unusable watch during the entire workout. I consider the OS in the GTR3 a step backwards. I'll probably keep it and hope they fix these issues. But I've emailed and opened several tickets with them and have never heard back. Also using the phone's app to report an issue is a waste of time and only triggers an email asking you to go to their website to fill out another ticket. Disappointed overall, hoping they'll fix these issues. At least Christmas shopping on Amazon allows for a return period through January, so I may still end up sending it back. If they fix any of my issues I'll  update this review."
Amy Rether,"Waited 10 months give my review..This thing holds up!I am a mechanic and have beat this thing up..Carburetor and brake cleaners were destroying my Fitbits and I thought I would try this out.I did buy a screen protector to keep the screen safe and definitely glad I did. The watch still looks nearly new still after all my abuse.  The tracking of my stats and the app are great. I just wish they would offer ecg in the USA.Notifications and the ability to answer and make phone calls on this, definitely help when my phone is in my pocket.  The faces available are nice and I found an app that has even more, than Amazfit offers.  I have the amazfit scale, which syncs with this watch and have trying to get my wife to switch over to this brand.  Still can't believe the battery lasts a week or more for me and charges fast too.."
Hossein Hashemi,"Nice smart watch. Especially for the price. First of all, Battery life is GREAT, I get about a week of battery life before charging at about 20% that is monitoring heart rate, oxygen level, steps and sleep. Is comfortable and light enough that you forget your wearing it. I have the brightness set to auto and that works great for me. There are alot of permissions to go through when you first set it up and go through them slowly to make sure caller ID and stuff work properly. Lol. I made that mistake at first as I was excited to have the watch. Screen is surprisingly sturdy and has taken quite a beating with no scratches at all.only  only downside is that it doesn't have a Google pay type app. But I knew this before I bought it. I Love to snorkel and swim and it tracks swimming exercise very well and handles being in the water for hours at a time with no issues."
Jorge Mu√±oz,"Love the battery life, working great, time will tell how long it will last"
SactoBob,"The Pros of what I like is that I can make phone calls on the watch without using my phone, It has a different look, There are accessories  available from other vendors to give you a different look and to protect the phone, also the length of the battery life.The Cons is that there really is no customer service for help or questions. There's a toll free number and when called it directs you to either a vm ot to send an email. To this date its been about two weeks still waiting for a response. If you send them more than one email they are the experts in avoiding to answer any questions at all. Also this Zenn app has a problem that it will not transfer your contacts the way it needs to be recognized for one to use the watch to dial out. If you have any contact numbers with dashes and parenthesis it will not work with the watch. I had to do extensive research and found the way to do it. Please keep in mind that the so call customer service has still not returned  my emails. Well this will work for Android phones. There is an app on Google play called Contacts. Once you download the app you will see your contacts and it is here that you can edit the contact numbers that the app didn't  do.In closing if I would of known about the lack and concerns I would of not bought the watch, let's see because I still have time to return the watch and all of the accessories.Good Luck"
NUNYA,"In order for me to lose weight, I must eat 500 calories less food than I burn in a day.  Therefore, I must know the actual calorie burn and adjust my food intake accordingly.  Given the fact that my days are not routine (I don't sit in a cube all day, every day) my calorie burn can vary by as much as 2000 calories from one day to the next.  I once worked at a physio lab and had access to clinical tools to measure metabolic rates and I  can make a pretty good guess at what I burn on a lazy day and on a physically demanding day (hauling and spreading dirt all day, for example) after using those tools for over three years on myself.  However, in order to lose the weight in a methodical manner, I can't guess, I have to KNOW what my calorie burn is so I may adjust how many calories I consume.  Unfortunately, this watch does NOT provide that information.  It will tell you how many calories you burn for a given activity like running or lifting weights, but that's it.  I contacted  support and they confirmed this.  As much as I wanted to love this watch (and there is a LOT to love!) the lack of this information is a deal killer for me.  It was the only reason I got this watch and needless to say, I was really disappointed to learn of this weakness.Things I love about this watch:  incredible display.  Bright and beautiful.  The ability to load apps to the watch.  Very comfortable to wear.  Adequate support; only took a couple of days to reply to my email and they actually answered my question, albeit a disappointing reply but at least they told me the truth.  OS is quite intuitive.  Most of the other measurements appear to be more or less accurate.  Step counter is very close to actual although this watch suffers from an issue that pretty much all wrist pedometers exhibit and that is a dramatic undercount when pushing a shopping cart through a grocery store.  Love the weather app.  Many of the functions work well, like playing music and linking your cell phone to it.  The internal speaker sounds about like you'd expect from a watch; tinny and thin but certainly audible.  Not an audiophile experience for sure!  SPO2 is accurate.  Heart rate is accurate, but only if you are relatively inactive.  It is NOT accurate during exercise.  I compared heart rate to my venerable Polar HRM with the chest strap and this watch is way way too high during exertion.  My theoretical max heart rate is 156.  During a spirited walk, this watch claimed my heart rate was 164.  If that was true, I'd need an ambulance!!  My Polar HRM indicated a HR of 124, which is accurate (I stopped and actually counted).  GPS seemed to work fine but I didn't use it much.I ended up with the Fitbit Charge 5 which DOES provide the information I desire even though it has significant weaknesses (like no real apps for it even though it purports to allow for them).Bottom line:  if you are only interested in activities or any of the other measurements it provides, this is a great watch.  However, if you are attempting to lose weight as I am and are tracking your calories in and out, this won't cut it."
Robert Deddo,"I have a few smart watches from Garmin, Samsung, and Amazfit. This one is by far the best looking. The associated app is getting better all the time. I normally use Garmin for my workouts, but I've been using the Amazfit more lately just to try out the features. Garmin is still the best for all around use, but Amazfit is really making some advances. I recommend, and you definitely can't beat the price."
Lex,all is good except text font TOO SMALL and hard to read.
S.D,                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†Great watch. Looks great and the battery life is about 3 weeks and that's with all monitoring enabled. Having alexa is really nice and making and receiving calls is great. Speaker is small but sounds good.
ted,"These were not very useful for me, so I went back to the Apple watch.It's a hard decision, both have their advantages but ultimately the integration of Amazfit with iOS is not as polished, missed notifications, and calls (even once a week is not ok). some data did not syncif you like the shape, and especially if you don't have iOS, get a regular non-pro versionPRO gives you:- temperature sensor- speaker (calls)- more watch facesbut ACTUALLY: - you get half the battery life - the temperature is not really accessible from the phone, there is no history, it's not precise -- total waste. - Microphone is good, but the speaker is not. there is no sim card, and you need your phone anyway - about the  same amount of useful watch customizationLet's say an extra 30% price bump for the PRO doesn't bother you, but a 100% increase in battery life should convince you to get a non-PRO version of this watch...PS. nitpicking on Amazfit:- alarm integration: phone alarm sound on the watch and the phone, so I have to turn off both of them- data does not sync to and from google fit/apple health apps well- heart rate during exercise and sleep tracking is not super reliable.- watch face selection is ... meh (and by the way, the apple watch has maybe 20 watch faces, which seems to be much smaller, but no, Apple lets you customize)"
TM from Gilbert AZ,Maybe if I was in a coma the battery life would last 21 days.  I‚Äôm charging it back up every six days but that good enough for me.
Joanna,"This is a very inconsistent fitness tracker that doesn't do anything well. It looks nice, and has some cool features, but they don't work all that well.Step counting:  Wildly inconsistent. Sometimes I'll walk a few hundred steps and it doesn't count them. Seems to just randomly decide not to work. I wear it correctly on my wrist, swing my arm etc. and nothing.Heart-rate: This randomly spikes out of nowhere when doing activities. Several times on walks I have had it measure 180ish BPM for several minutes. Stopping to take my heartrate manually revealed it was around 100-110, while the watch still read 180. This skews workout results.SPO2 and other sensors: Your have to hold perfectly still for 45 seconds to get a reading. If you move at all it errors.App: The app has no way to manually add data, super disappointing. No way to delete or edit data either if you accidentally start a workout or leave your watch running for a few minutes after a workout.Treadmill: Horrible for treadmill. Severely undercounts distances and steps with a limited adjustment range, and it doesn't adjust your steps. Should be easy enough to have an algorithm to approximate steps based on your stride length or average stride length for your body.Music: The bluetooth connection is horrible with my Pixel Buds. It constantly has noise and drops. Not very useful.Positives: It looks nice and is responsive. Has decent battery life. GPS is fast and accurate.I will probably return this as it is defective."
JTC,"Ok, some of the changeable watch faces are free in the app, but charging for most of them is a bit of a kick in the pants for a $200 watch.  You'd think they could set them all free, or at least allow 3rd party watch faces.  Sure, the faces only cost $2-3 each, and if I can afford a $200 watch, I can certainly afford a few extra dollars for a new face. With that in mind though, if the faces are so cheap, why not provide them for free?Functionality seems good so far.  I'm curious to see how accurate the fitness functions are.  SpO2 is off according to another device I own."
Amy Rether,"The information you can get from this watch is awesome!! The step tracker seems to be much more accurate than older trackers, which would count a step if you moved your arm to fast. The heart rate moniter does a great job and the daily and weekly tracking is nice to check. The sleep tracker is very informative, and pretty accurate, from how much time you were in deep sleep, and even how much, and when you were awake. There is also stress monitering, blood oxygen, and calories burnt. I do not have any apps on it because I do not carry my phone at work, and the watch and app do a great job of syncing once the two are in bluetooth range. The only downside is that there are a lot of neat watch faces to pick from,  , for a price. The one shown in the photo is one of the few free watch faces, the rest have a starting price of $1.99, and up from there."
Darrell Perdue,For the longest time I needed a good wrist watch. I thought a smart watch would be a good thing with all the new technology we have now. There is so many different kinds to chose from. I recommend you look through a lot of them and find just the right one for you. You won't be disappointed.
Darrell Perdue,smartwatch is awesome
BuTeK,"Battery life is killer! Best I have ever had on any smart watch, and I have had many.  Navigation clean and simple.  Features fantastic for the money, nothing else even comes close.  Connection with app and smart phone super easy.  Face crazy bright and clear, wow.  Work out 5 days a week, great tracking and as accurate as any wrist worn product.Very happy with purchase."
Bruce Hutcherson,"I don't use many of the features such as heart rate, oxygen or sleep analysis but the features I use work very well. I use it as a GPS pedometer, text and phone notification, alarm and time. I like that you can adjust the sensitivity to flicking your wrist to turn on the time function, unlike on a previous smartwatch I had from another brand. Why 4 stars? The user manual is terrible. Not only is it difficult to follow some of the illustrations are in Chinese. It reads as if some automatic translation program was used to transcribe it to English and nobody bothered to even proofread it."
Ben,"I have owned many smart watches over last few years and this may be my favorite right now at under $200 when on sale.Best features:Watch face is very sharp and bright. Easy to see outside.Easy to read text messages.Weight is super light. Get a nylon band on it and you won't know it's there.Good selection of watch faces that has been getting larger. 150+Alexa speach controls.Some watch functions can be activated by voice. Unique feature!Super long list of sport tracking activities. 150.Auto start activity tracking on walk, run, bike.Loud watch speaker with good alarm/notifications sound.Nice amount of watch memory storage for music.All smart watch functions work well if phone is connected properly.Sleep and heart rate tracking very good.Internal phone book for out calls is large.Super long battery life.Charges quickly.Fast GPS connection for workouts.Poor features:Step tracking is very inaccurate.  Under counts steps by at least 20% or more.Under counts floors climbed or not at all.Zepp app is not the greatest and must always be running in background for smart watch functions to work. Very important.GPS tracking is also inaccurate. Distance traveled is always short by 10-20%GTR 3 Pro as a smart watch it is one of the best you can buy at under $200. Wait for it to be on sale before you pull the trigger. It's a great value then. Not worth more.Poor accuracy when it comes to steps and floors climbed. GPS distance accuracy also bad.If you want better step/floor accuracy buy a Fitbit or a Garmin. Unfortunately their smart watch functions are not as good and they cost a lot more."
Beckyj221,"Very good product, value for money"
Michael Mayer,"I liked this watch for most of what it seemed to do.  I had no problems setting it up with the phone app and it was entertaining to swap out the varying watch faces although very few of the were customizable.  I'm in a wheel chair and it would have been nice to change the 'step' application to something else on a lot of the faces, ha.  The watch mechanics and programming all seemed great except it never recognizes when I got to sleep but the ergonomics were subpar.  The watchband only fit my wrist using the last hole and I found the band a bit hard. I think I prefer soft silicone.  The sensor array is elevated several millimeters above the back of the watch.  After wearing it a few hours I had some significant wrist discomfort.  It is a big watch and I think the back of the watch should be flush with the sensor array to avoid this.  I have to return it as I cannot wear it for long and I need to monitor my sleep."
Michael Mayer,Sleep tracking graph shows the heart rate and breathing during all the sleeping cycles. You can select alerts for the highest and lowest rates.
Mark,Bough as gift and it's great wish I bought for myself.
klimyflorez,"Battery life definitely over a week and charges in a few hours. So easy to set-up and I'm old and not tech savvy. Easy to read and I can set alarms separately from the alarms on my phone! Love love love. Best smart watch I ever had. Only take it off to charge. It's waterproof! I've had apple, nope this is better. I've had fit bit, nope this is better! And I like the way it looks!"
golfman007,"Was a diehard fitbit user, but their devices never seemed to last much longer than the warranty.  Still getting used to my GTR4 but it's great on first pass: great screen, easy to manipulate controls, good battery life which you can extend by reducing frequency of HR updates.  So far I prefer the FB app, but that may change with increased familiarity.  Will update as I have more experience."
golfman007,"                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†I can go a week with no charge, I got it manly because I'm on oxygen and the read is almost accurate on here for the O2 sensor, it's off by 2 but knowing that helps me. Some of the features don't work on Android or iPhone like the Temp and EKG reading and Blood pressure and that's why I gave it 4 stars but all around best watch I have had. This watch replaced my Fossil Gen 5"
Saul Nathanson,"I like this watch, everything is great, one good surprise I found is the inducing sleep feature on the app which based on your HR changes IA music to help you fall asleep, once you fall asleep the music stops automatically (the app detects it with the sensors), unfortunately this feature is not free, it's us$39/year with promo discount, if this feature was  $5 or $10 that would be great but otherwise this is a good smartwatch"
JTC,"I was a bit skeptical at first, but the less-than-a-day battery life from my Apple watch became too annoying to continue dealing with.  I haven't reached the end of the battery life yet, since I take it off and charge it every 4 or 5 days simply because I get tired of wearing it.As for features, it has everything I need and more.  I assumed the support, by which I mean available apps, software/firmware updates would be sparse since it's not one of the dominant brands, however it's far exceeded my expectations in those areas.  Amazfit is clearly putting a lot of resources behind their products.Overall this watch has exceeded all of my expectations, and I wouldn't be surprised if this company starts gaining serious ground on Apple, Garmin, etc."
Amy Rether,"Love this watch! For the cost, it‚Äôs not bad at all for how much features it has. It‚Äôs perfect for how uncomplicated it is. I‚Äôm pretty techie but when it comes to watches for work outs, I need something basic. I‚Äôd rather spend my energy on the actual work out than having to fiddle with a watch with too many features."
Paul O,"Good build quality, image quality is good. Step function is not close to being dependable, sleep function is useless. It cannot tell the difference between sleeping, napping and being awake. It indicates sleeping when watching TV. Would I but this watch again, probably not at the price that it is now, maybe if less than $100.00."
Paul O,"Long time Fitbit and Samsung Galaxy Active users. I first bought the T-Rex Pro and my wife pined over the 18-20 day battery life I received and excellent app connection. Our Fitbits had so many connectivity issues with our Galaxy phones it was maddening. When we tried the Galaxy watches their battery life was abysmal. We picked up this GTR 3 for my wife and she gets 18-20 day battery life and loves the design and screen. I love the look of my T-Rex Pro but am a bit envious of her screen. It's phenomenal. Anyway our son now also has a T-Rex Pro so we are all in on Amazfit. (And our daughter and he iWatch SE has massive battery envy- she gets @ 18 hours tops, which is just horrible)"
Yoav,"                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†Muy bueno el reloj, me gust√≥ mucho. Estoy muy satisfecho"
citizenezitic,"Overall a nice watch but yall need some work on your apps, especially the weather app. Every time I check the weather on my watch it has always been off 8 degrees than what it actually is outside. What‚Äôs the the point of a weather app if it can‚Äôt be accurate. But other than that all in all it‚Äôs a nice watch."
Aleksandr,"-Just got this yesterday, so not a longevity review, full stop‚Ä¶Pros:-Beautiful display-Super responsive touch and screen response-After full charge, 24 plus hours off charger still @ 94% charge with most features enabled, an hour of cardio tracking, lift to wake enabled etc etc etc‚Ä¶ good battery-comfortable to wear even when slightly tight on the wrist-perfectly ok without the speaker and phone calls featureMinor cons:-missing the lock option when wearing-while screen is beautiful, almost all of the available watch faces are mediocre-there is over 2.3 GB of available storage, by almost no apps, to use that storage(wish there was option to use bt headphones to steam from watch)So really overall this is a beautiful health tracker with some smartwatches features.Just before the sale and purchase the Mobvoi ticwatch pro 3.  I had it for a few days. But it was incredibly laggy, and had nowhere near the stated battery life even when consistently in the essential mode which is supposed to give you up to 45 days. I would lose 3 to 5% over a few hour. While in essential mode. So moving back to amazfit‚Ä¶ So far I am 95.9% satisfied with this watch for $50 less than a Mobvoi, and way more comfortable making already tell the battery life is going to be better.üëç"
Capt Jim Roach,"Bought this for my son, he loves it and has received a number of compliments on it.  Great functions with great battery life."
michel l nash,"I was a little skeptical about this watch at first, but I'm really glad I got it. The battery has lasted me almost 3 weeks on one charge, setup was easy,  and it does everything I need plus some. Definitely worth it!"
michel l nash,Great watch. Love all it can do.
Kindle Customer,"I am a user of the Amazfit what since the first version which I needed to replace because of a battery issue.  And I bought this watch for my son to use before deciding to by one myself.  So I did my research and decided on the GTR3 as the best replacement.  Unfortunately, this watch being relatively new on the market there were not too many reviews and most of them covered the GPR3 and GPR3 PRO.  I thought that the difference then was only cosmetic...  So I was very disappointed to realize that the GPR3 (not PRO) does not have the internal music storage as the larger GPR3 PRO.  So if you like to listen to music while you run and not carry the phone with you will NOT be able to do it with this watch!  All other sport/health features are as described and really top of the line!"
Mayavrilya,"La app es muy estable, no tiene tantas opciones pero las funciones b√°sicas las hace muy bien."
DMM,"You can't beat the price, and the battery life is excellent. I was getting sick of charging my previous smart watch every day. This one, I plug it in every two weeks.The apps and face store doesn't have much content, but I wasn't interested on that. Actually, some less esoteric faces will be nice. If apps and features are important to you, you may want to look elsewhere. If all you need is steps counting or exercise tracking, sleep tracking, and a few more metrics, this might be the right watch for you."
daniel baran,"La bater√≠a depende del uso, y programaci√≥n del seguimiento de los sensores"
JTC,I have been so impressed with this watch. It can do everything that a really expensive watch can do and then some. I have been really impressed and just love it. Thank you.
Amy Rether,"La duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a es espectacular, la app es muy buena y entrega la informaci√≥n necesaria, f√°cil de configurar, varias opciones de monitoreo."
Lesley,El reloj a salido muy bien lo unico que no esta el la conexion por wifi
Ted Evans,No trabaja la apliccaion Alexa en Panam√° y para ser un serie 3 debi√≥ tener llmaadas por Bluetooth ya q el dos si tiene la opci√≥n.. por lo dem√°s muy bien
M&E DAD,The sleep tracking doesn't give me a sleep score because I work at night and sleep during the day. It thinks I'm napping excessively. I am suffering from burns where the watch sits on my wrist.
Llegaron en la fecha estimada,"Get this one over the GTR 4. It looks better, bigger and better screen, and all the same stuff as the four but this does not have muscle auto tracking or whatever, which my Jefit workout app does anyways. For 140, this is clearly the best watch choice on the market. You can change your watch face look easy as well!"
Llegaron en la fecha estimada,"Went from a Samsung watch active 2 to this watch it's a huge difference. the battery life wow I went form charging every eight hours to every 10 days so far yep I'm at 10 days and still having a 19% charge left pretty incredible. all the apps work great it has everything I need to use daily with notifications and alarms. workouts are great a huge amount of choices. the measurements so far are pretty accurate. the only compliant I have is the sleep tracking is garbage it worked great the first night but after that works either sometimes or not at all, they have said they are working on a fix so I hoe it will come out soon. Other than that I do not miss my Samsung watch at all and plan to stick with this watch. Also it will work with any 22mm watch band so I have bought a few to change my look here are some links for you.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDW32MD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09F6Q1NRD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1And some great screen protectorshttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09NXGCQ1P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09N6QQ5FQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
C&A,This watch works well for tracking heart rate and I also find getting messages on my wrist saves time...I would buy again if something happened to this one
Twitchyleg,Finally got this watch up and running except for replying to SMS texting. Contacted support and they said at this time they do not support replies to SMS texting. They did however say they support messages and what's up. Maybe they will have a fix for SMS texting reply in the future. Other wise this is a very good smart watch.
chuck,"I've had a Samsung gear S3 for 6 years, but the battery was going bad and I didn't like the features or price of their Galaxy Watch 4.  After looking and doing my DD I came across the Amazfit GTE 3 Pro.  It tracked y steps perfectly, which the Samsung did to (at twice the price) and also gave me five times more exercises to track, great weather, alarms (I use three daily plus two on weekends) and accurate heart rate.Oh, here's the kicker:  While I got 4 days on te Samsung gear S3, I got 12 days, yes full 12 days battery on the Amazfit.I'll see how this holds up over time and amend my review if I think it's necessary.Great smartwatch, especially for the price."
Stephanie Schiller,Too many pros to mention. But a major flaw IMO is when caught in a rain or taking shower the watch does crazy things such as making a random call. I personally do not take my watch off only for charging. This con is frustrating to me.
LS,"Tras 3 semanas de uso, no he tenido ning√∫n inconveniente, funciona bien y la bater√≠a dura de 8 a 10 dias dependiendo del uso."
Frank Schumann,I wanted this primarily to notify me of text messages and phone calls as I have to take them 24/7 for my job.  I also demand long battery life as I can‚Äôt be charging every day.It does those things exceptionally well!  Very positive vibration which you can customize so you don‚Äôt miss any notifications!  Also VERY good battery!  I use the watch a lot and usually recharge after two weeks when it‚Äôs around 50%.  Admittedly I do not have the auto wake up for the screen enabled and I do not keep most of the fitness trackers enabled.  I am very pleased with this compared to the last $40 smart watch piece of junkola I had!
JTC,"I really want to like this watch/fitness tracker but I'm tired of standing for several hours in the kitchen doing all the usual kitchen things and yet it keeps reminding every hour that I've been sitting down for an hour and I should take a walk.  I haven't' done anything but stand at the counter, walk around the kitchen to the fridge, stove, oven and yet it somehow thinks all I've been doing is sitting down.  I think it probably tracks my steps fairly well but hard to tell if it continues to think I'm sitting when I'm doing anything but."
Amy Rether,"I had my eyes on this watch and I wasn‚Äôt wrong. It‚Äôs so beautiful. The face is big and minimalistically shining. The leather band is so soft I don‚Äôt even feel it on my wrist. The watch is fairly responsive, but not as well as my apple watch series 4. The app is easy to use.Feature-wise, I love the sleep tracking. It seems to be on par w my apple watch. The workout counts the calories a bit up I think but that‚Äôs alright. The gps is awesome. But I have to return it. Why?I love to have one central place to visualize all my data, be it Apple Health or Google Fit. Unfortunately the Zepp app only syncs active calories to Apple Health, not other workout details. For this reason, my rings don‚Äôt close despite finishing way enough workouts. I turn to Android, unpairing the watch from my iphone and use my android tablet instead. I don‚Äôt have an android phone and the app is not available for tablets. I have to download the apk from apkmirror. That‚Äôs fine. But on Android, while it sends more data to google fit, it syncs HIIT session as ‚Äúwalking‚Äù, and doesn‚Äôt even give me any heart points. Enough to say the app doesn‚Äôt sync well on either platform.Amazfit advertises this as 7-day battery of heavy use. What‚Äôs my use? I don‚Äôt care about all the notifications so I turn them all off. I don‚Äôt even use always on display. I just keep hr monitor every 10 min, stress every 5 min, spo2 off. Essentially just the fitness stuff is on minus spo2. I only use it for indoor workout so no gps. Sleep tracking is on with breath monitoring. This consumes roughly > 30% a day, so 3 days max, not 7 days. I guess one could say if I turn off some more features, it‚Äôll help the battery. Sure. Then why Don‚Äôt I just get a regular watch‚Ä¶And the temperature sensor‚Ä¶ it constantly gives me 32 degC. Sure it‚Äôs influenced by the env. But if it cannot really give body temp, why bother having it at all?So tldr: beautiful watch, seems accurate hr/sleep monitor. Battery is better than many but only half as good as advertised."
Daniel Castrillon,"It does not allow for phone calls answering and calling on a Samsung 10. Otherwise, a nice watch that I wear all the time."
Isaac Rodriguez,I have gone through several Fitbits over the years and they always seem to break right after the warranty expired.  This watch is easy to use and has just enough smartwatch features to get by.  Battery life is amazing.  I am getting almost 7 full days!  The only downside I have found is the sleep tracking is sub-par.  It rarely recognizes or measures sleep like Fitbit.  I just purchased their scale and it syncs to the app easily and is also a great buy.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
Leonardo Molano,Was looking for a replacement for my Apple Watch and so glad I found this one! What a great watch. Love the size. The info available is amazing and the app is easy to use. Battery life is unbelievable. I have had it 6 weeks and charged it twice! Love this watch!!
Janet Rethmann,"Es mucho mejor que otros relojes smart que he comprado como fossil o el mismo Apple Watch. Realmente su mejor caracter√≠stica es la bater√≠a, en su rendimiento normal con monitoreo y dem√°s realmente cumple su promesa de bater√≠a, me ha durado semanas. Es bastante preciso en sus mediciones y muy lindo est√©ticamente, se confunde mucho con el dise√±o del huawei. Excelente reloj."
Alfredo,"Update: Despite initial positive impressions, after just under 2 months and now am having issues. Same workout that was giving me 7500-8500 steps, now only gives me 3500 steps, and starting to get wonky heart rate readings as well. Reached out to customer service, will update once they reply. Dissapointed at the moment. Initial impression of the Amazfit GTR 3 is pretty positive. Lots of great features, good battery life, nice clear display and intuitive functions etc. Only complaint so far is the sleep tracking does not seem great. Does not seem to recognize awake times during the night. There have been days when I know I had significant awake times during the night and it shows zero awake time. Not a huge issue, but would be nice if it tracked correctly."
Sergio Herrera,"                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†El reloj est√° muy bien construido, se siente bien al lucirlo, he cambiado la pulsera, pero la original es igualmente c√≥moda. Hay mucha car√°tula, pero no encuentro algo sobrio con facilidad. La bater√≠a est√° bien, pero esta lejos de modelos como el Verge Lite, que durama m√°s.de.tres semanas. En general es buena elecci√≥n."
James M.,"Nice watch, heart tracker pretty accurate and amazing  battery life but I think it's little bit overpriced!"
WickedClownz,"I really have liked the watches from Amazfit--they don't always have the most functions, but the battery life is usually much better than the android or apple alternative. They don't do as much, but you also don't have to recharge every day.I got this upgrade because I wanted the upgraded sensors to monitor sleep, blood oxygen levels and sleep.  Over the Amazfit Bip S, when it monitors sleep I get deep sleep and now REM sleep as well as other measures. The Bip S has older sensors --not bad, but don't monitor as much.I like the new screen and the crown.  It does not have the same battery life as the Bip S, but I was able to get over a week with 30% left.The only thing--I think we'll need new 3rd party extra charging cables, as the 3rd party charging cables for the Amazfit GTR 2 e will not work, the charging pins are a bit narrow compared to the new conntor for the GTR 3"
WickedClownz,"Overall great watch in general. Many capabilities. Amd I am happy with it.Things I didn't like are the bulky crown button which is being pressed accidentally all the time.In addition once bluetooth calls are enabled it takes priority over the phone in answering calls , whick results in 5 sec delay anytime I try answering the phone."
acdcman75,"This watch is definitely one of the best on the market, if not the best. There are so many different features that I didn‚Äôt know I needed until now, like the suggestions about if it is good weather to workout outdoors. I also love the stress level measurement as I check it periodically throughout my workout and my work day so I know if I need to take a break to bring my stress levels down. The blood oxygen level measurement is also very unique and helpful to check during my workouts, as well as the heartbeat monitor.The workouts itself have a ton of options making it easy to customize my workout and track it accurately! I also love that I can customize my own goals and change them as I feel I need to. Of all of the amazing benefits, my favorite of all is the extended battery life! I‚Äôm not worried about charging my watch every night and love that I can go days without having to take it off, especially since I can then track my sleep at night. I cannot recommend this watch enough!!!"
Lori Burris,"Sin duda el mejor en precio calidad!Mejores que la anterior generaci√≥n, cumple con todo lo que dice en su descripcion.la bater√≠a dura 5 d√≠as full seguimiento.GPS mejorado.Recomendado !"
Lori Burris,"Watch has a lot to offer, also pretty lite, build quality is nothing to brag about, battery life is awesome. Does most of what the more expensive one do but at a far less cost.Right now I'm wearing another watch as this one sits in a drawer. Not as many bells and whistles but I like the one I'm  now wearing better"
JTC,Battery life is ok can get 4 or 5 days easily
Amy Rether,The battery life and the sleep features are tops.  I could not have ask for a better smartwatch at this time. Thank you.
Amazon Customer,"Nice watch. Great to sink with phone for calls and messages. If that's all you want, it's fine. I bought primarily as a fitness tracker and it is wildly inaccurate. The past few days I track about a thousand steps on my drive to work while traveling 80 mph on the interstate.... I find i have to remove it when i drive to keep from throwing off my steps by a ton. The heart rate tracking is so far off it's not worth using. No matter how I position it or how tight it's on it's not even close. After 20 minutes on my bike my chest mounted tracker has me at 165ish while the watch clocks in around 75... I will be returning for a second unit to see if this one is defective. I had the same issues with the GTR 2 I bought 2 years ago. Wanted to see if the newer models were an improvement since the reviews are great but so far it has been a let down again.Update: after using daily for a month, instand by the 1 star. Nice watch, crap fitness tracker. It will at times track correctly but if at any time you bump something at stop your current workout, it's over. Apparently  your heart can drop from 170bpm to 80bpm in the few seconds it takes to start a new workout on the watch.  Once this happens the watch is incapable of getting back on track and your heart rate will stay at a wildly inaccurate range. Back to the chest strap. Would not recommend this product."
Mark,"Okay, I have an iPhone and this is not an iWatch, I didn‚Äôt expect that. What I wanted and expected I did get, and more. This watch synced great and stays synced. It tracks everything I want and more. It shows my notifications and calls without having to look at the phone. And I only need to charge it for about an hour or two every 2 - 3 WEEKS!  I can actually track my sleep every night since I don‚Äôt need to charge it every night. If you want an iWatch, get one, if you want just a watch with lots of perks, this is great."
Scott Clark,"I absolutely love a good watch that seamlessly connects my physical lifestyle to a digital graph. As someone who lives on the road, the battery life here is top notch. The tracking is extremely accurate, and the different workout modes are robust. The ONLY problem I have is my lifestyle is too integrated to the Google family that WearOS is critical for me. Ive realized you sacrifice battery life with WearOS, so honestly I may come back after testing the upcoming Pixel Watch this fall since Amazfit has the absolute best quality and tracking."
L. Henry,"Very good watch, filled with a lot of apps and stuff."
Sergio Bola√±os Rodr√≠guez,Valores de saturaci√≥n y frecuencia card√≠aca  muy similares a productos m√©dicos.GPS trabaja super bienMonitoreo de sue√±o muy completoSeguimiento de entrenamiento muy satisfactorio
Works2much,"I'm very happy with this watch.  Unlike the Fitbit I have,  this watch at my current settings will last 7-8 days per charge.  I have to have my phone on silent often and routinely miss calls and texts until now.  The sleep monitoring has been a game changer. The accuracy of the sleep score to how my days go is motivation to do better in that area.  The price point on this watch made it worth a try. I made the right decision."
betsyb,Good for the price. Lot off watch faces available. Compare to Apple watch heart rate & steps are correct. But is ok for me as I am mainly using it as watch with calling features.
Yooo,I did a lot of research and watched a lot of YouTube reviews before buying this watch. This is my first smartwatch and I was going to get the apple watch 7 I really had to think what my main reason for a smartwatch was. I always have my phone with me and think most people do as well so I really just wanted to track my health and sleep. I‚Äôm not gonna use it to buy coffee or anything like that so this was just perfect for my needs. It has alot of features and is pretty accurate with the new OS update. The battery is amazing and the watch faces are great. Once this went on sale for $200 I was like add to cart. It‚Äôs been great and exactly what I expected. One of the best things I‚Äôve bought off Amazon
Jim,To find new faces you have to try several apps. Battery life is only good if you change the right settings.  You can get any where from one day to a week or so depending on how many settings you turn off. They should have more than 2 buttons to program. Compass seems accurate within a few degrees to true north. But for the price it does what it says so I'm just ok.
Shawn,"Long life battery,  wonderful watch. Amazing watch."
JTC,Works good. Great battery life
Amy Rether,Night for 2 reasons#1 Sleep#2 BatteryEither battery sensor don't work or in using right needs better video to show how these work.
Amazon Customer,Very nice watchI really recommend it
Mar√≠a F.,Cannot answer the phone
Jerome Holderman,"I was interested in this unit because of the long battery life and overall functionality.  Not being someone who lives on his phone and smart watch I found that the features that attracted me were basic heart rate, sleep, show messages and perhaps other features as I get to use it further.  It is a little big for my wrist and I considered returning it for the GSR 3 but decided to keep it.  Overall it suits my needs and I am especially glad that I don't have to constantly charge it."
Jerome Holderman,"I was in the market for a smartwatch for a while now, but I couldn‚Äôt find a model that fit my taste until this one. I love the classic big round screen display, and the leather band adds elegance and value to the watch.  I love the different watch face options, with convenient heart rate reading/steps/breathing rate. Some allow you to see the entire week‚Äôs weather forecast, humidity level, etc., and super easy to read incoming text messages and pick up calls (loud and clear) without holding a phone in your hand.  The one-button health measurements allow you to measure your heart rate, stress level, and breathing count at once. And a reminder for standing and walking every hour to keep up with healthy well-being.  One other cool feature: I started to wear this watch last Thursday. Almost a week into it, there‚Äôs still 20% battery life left. This is so cool, all the other smartwatches my friends own, they practically needed to charge them every day."
Orlando Palma,A lil bit misleading regarding answering Bluetooth calls on their adverstisement because you can see notification but you aren't able to answer through phone like other smart watches.
Orlando Palma,"I have read some mixed reviews on the Amzfit GTR3. I, however, am finding it truly ""amazing."" It has many features lacking in other watches. It even includes a compass and calendar! The GPS works very well. It gives a ton of information and the Zepp app for your phone (mine is Android) works very well, again with lots of information. I recommend this watch very highly. And, oh, it is very good looking too!"
Salim,"Having owned two Fitbits and a couple of cheap knock-off smartwatches, I have to say the battery life on this one is amazing. After wearing the watch 24 hrs a day for 7 days, I decided to charge it up again even though it still had a 40% charge.So far the data collected looks accurate, and the sleep algorithms seem accurate, but the formula used for calculating kcal gives results that are 1/10 of what my Fitbits told me in the past. If I were only burning 300 kcal a day, while eating well over 2,000, I would be looking at getting gastric bypass surgery like, yesterday. Something is very wrong.Aside from that, it's a good watch. Good readability, easy to operate, decent app."
@youcantseeme,"Wondering how the sensor is even keeping proper track of my heart rate? Hahaha it's been less than 90 days... There is no way my heart rate is being tracked anymore, pretty ridiculous. Oh and contacting the company for replacement....  hahahaha The Amazon support was like,,, oh you can just call them, NOT! ü§£ make sure to get a piece of paper to write down all the BS you need from their support page,,, now wouldn't it be easier if Amazon supported the watch. I don't know... over it for today. ü§Ø"
Yackov,This watch is a huge upgrade from my gtr. I love the crown and the haptics. The screen is super clear and its nice to see so many health details on the watch rather than having to look at the app. I put a case and a new band on it. Its a little bigger than I would prefer but thats not a big issue. Its super light weight and great overall.
Briana ,"Coming to the GTR 3 from a Galaxy Active Watch 2 which died from water damage. The GTR is very comparable to the GAW 2, short to more limited notification interactivity, such as being able to answer messages and picture previews. Besides that, fitness tracking is on par with the Samsung. The GPS seems slightly more accurate and health functions are equally as good. After having all that said, the GTR 3 does all this while lasting magnitudes longer than the GAW2. I used to charge my watch every day, and now I easily get more than a week with the same use. Really impressive stuff. UPDATE: You're now capable to answer to text messages after a new firmware."
Juli√°n Soto,"What an awesome watch! After 10 days of non stop use, I got 50% battery life left. The Zepp OS and app is purpose driven unlike the afterthought wear OS. Comming from my 8 year old LG Urbane, this is a huge upgrade. The app turns all you equipment into smart fitness trackers. Even my 25 year old bike has brains now. Well done Amazfit (Zepp)!"
E7Grunt,Muy √∫til y excelente reloj
JTC,"El GPS es lento, tomar fotos desde el reloj no es f√°cil se desempareja f√°cil del celular.Buena duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a y muchas funcionalidades."
Amy Rether,Returned. Face too big on wrist
Clyde Hilliard,"Los materiales se sienten de gran calidad.Las funciones son suficientesSi no te interesa hablar desde el reloj como los power rangers escoge este y no el PRO.La bater√≠a me dura m√°s de 7 d√≠as con uso constante debido al entrenamiento 4 o 5 d√≠as por semana.La app es intuitiva, hay suficientes car√°tulas para cambiar.Nota. Las fotos son tomadas atrav√©s de la app de Amazon no son tan buenas y hacen parecer la pantalla con colores malos as√≠ como la calidad pero en realidad se ven muy bien."
Rajwant,"Switched from a fitbit to this smartwatch - I couldn't be happier.  Battery life is incredible, display is crisp, and there are more features on this watch than I know what to do with.  Importantly, the watch actually easily syncs to the app on my Android phone.  Firmware updates take about a minute.  GPS is fantastic."
sean  biglane,"My husband is not a tech savvy person but he loves his watch. I purchased the pro because it said he could quick reply to texts, you can't. I was very disappointed with that."
William Bean,"El reloj tiene un bonito dise√±o, no molesta en la mu√±eca y las funciones son completas.Con la pantalla siempre encendida (always on) la bater√≠a ronda los 3 d√≠as con todos los sensores monitoreando.Un excelente smartwatch.Lo √∫nico que no me gust√≥ es que aunque s√≠ sincroniza con Google fit, los datos no son tan precisos y las rutina de ejercicios no las reconoce el app de Google, por lo que me qued√© con la aplicaci√≥n Zepp."
AntiEmerej,I've got every single setting on and notification turned on and my battery still last 7-10 days I workout 5 days a week and use it for my workouts and barely puts a dent in my battery. If samsung were to make a smart watch they should take notes from this company.  If you're on the fence buy this watch.
Juan Antonio Sucre F,I love this watch for its appearance and style. I bought it to work out on the treadmill for my heart rate. Unfortunately this watche's technology is not accurate. I have used it several times and the heart rate is never right. I have had it checked out multiple times. The distance tracker and steps are usually off by quite a bit. This watch is great looking and I love how you can change the face.
Diego Quitiaquez,"This watch has been a pleasant surprise!!  Love the battery life, answering calls on my watch along with all the tracking is far above expectations!!  I can receive sms messages and would be great to reply to sms messages on the watch along with answering calls!  But I imagine that update is coming I‚Äôm hoping bud I can answer calls and all that on my watch and it‚Äôs wonderful.  Great watch and I highly recommend it"
Brent McKee,La bater√≠a no dura solo para 8 d√≠as y es mucho se descarga m√°s que todo en la noche mucho la verdad no se por que deber√≠a tener un asesor para solucionar el problema
Arif,"In one word, excellent"
Arif,"Llevo m√°s de 1 mes probando este reloj y todo excelente, lo √∫nico que no me gusta es que las esferas que est√°n en la tienda son algo caro con respecto a las funciones, deber√≠an haber m√°s esferas gratis, pero en funci√≥n todo muy bien."
Steven,"So far, I haven't really used all the apps, but I love the watch, battery life is outstanding and communication with my phone seems great.  I feel like this is a very good watch for a great price.  I had a previous Amazfit that was rectangular shaped and smaller.  It worked great but I much prefer the size and readability of this watch!"
JTC,"The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that I can‚Äôt customize the faces on the watch! And there a lot of the free but most of them have to be purchased. Other than that, the watch is awesome!"
Amy Rether,This watch has a ton of features. Setup is a breeze and everything so far work flawlessly.
Curtis H.,"Muy sastisfecho con Amazfit GTR 3 Pro, excelente funciones! Recomendado"
Trung thanh Nguyen,Is an excellent smart watch. Tracks my steps and even my reps at the gym with perfection. The only issue I have is that it doesn‚Äôt always automatically connect to my phone. You have to open the app and allow it to sync. A minor problem for a good smartwatch.
Trung thanh Nguyen,"I'll try and keep this short and sweet.  The watch has a great display and seems to track all my activities.  However, when I tried to add ""music"" to it, it would say it added all my songs but then would only play a few of them.  I tried rebooting the watch, doing a factory reset, and then starting all over with the same results.  It would not download all of my songs properly.  I contacted Amazfit support and they took a couple of days to respond.  But when they responded, they had no solution to my problem!  I liked the display, the sleep tracking, receiving texts, and having my activities monitored, but without music, it didn't fit my needs.  Also, the battery was just ""so-so"" with about six-(6) days of battery life, but then again, I was playing around with it a lot.  I returned the watch and sent back to my Garmin Vivoactive 4.  My Garmin did everything well except for the ""sleep tracking"" part, but that was not a real priority with me."
Amit Kumar Roy,"It took many attempts to pair gtr3 pro to zepp. Although paired, the link frequently failed and was extremely difficult to reconnect. I had a whizkid try to resolve problems and get it working, he had a very difficult time as well.Additionally, Alexa has never worked. He tried everything but watch kept reporting a failure.He finally succeeded in getting calls and messages to the watch. Unfortunately it kept failing to allow giving a response to the message.I purchased the watch to provide monitoring of my heart, stress level,oxygen and sleep quality. And possibly get alerts if results exceeded limits when working in the garden etc. Also I thought the watch would receive calls if the phone was nearby. Not the case. If the phone was in my pocket it worked, otherwise nothing.Consequently. The watch is very frustrating to setup and to keep it linked to zepp, and unreliable for monitoring. I plan on talking to colleagues who have Samsung and other brands to see if the are experiencing similar problems."
Banana76,"Yes, it's not 100% accurate but no watch is let's get realistic... If you want it to be 100 percent accurate go buy each individual thing. Compared to my Fitbit it's pretty much the same thing and I like this wayyy better than Fitbit it's so much prettier and clear, more like a watch and just as good. Step count is alot lower than Fitbit but I always thought Fitbit was a bit to high for step and calorie count I feel like this is more accurate. Definitely worth it for me!"
Amazon Customer,"Size is perfect. Love the battery life. Features are excellent. Display is tough. Great watch, fitness tracker, etc."
Amazon Customer,battery duration is amazing one charge is enough for 15 days
bob,"3 days on less than 100% charge & still at 75%, battery life is on par if not better than my daughters Amazfit band 5. Zep App has menstrual tracking for ladies, sooo many workouts (you can customize your list of workouts on the watch), customize the widgets, the app list, your most used for display. Music player controls Audible! Still twerking the setup but so far it's amazing! Pairing did take a bit but only because I couldn't get my phone to scan the QR code, after it was paired haven't had issues with connection."
Amazon Customer,"This product exceeded my expectations. All features are accurate, the watch looks great and feels great. The app is easy to use and has very detailed stats. Only thing is the battery life is not as advertised, but still very good. One full charge can run 12-14 days depending on how many and how often you use certain features."
Niva Suwal,"Not as nice as my Garmin, but worth the cost for non-serious exercisers."
GAnderson,"I had to post this review. I had my watch on doing yard work  then oh no!..I didn't.Rain was coming and I looked everywhere...couldn't find it and was really irritated. It rained, I worried....still couldn't find it  24 hours later I found it. IN THE BOTTOM OF A 5 GALLON BUCKET OF WATER!!  I was sure it was done for  NOPE! it is still 100% working. So, for that reason alone, I would give it 10 stars if I could!!"
JTC,"This is an awesome smart watch, it has a lot of functionality. Had zero issues with phone alerts and the readings for heart rate and oxygen levels look about right.The battery will last about ~18/20 days depending on use, I go for a run 5 days a week and use the watch to track it.So far very happy with the performance, I upgraded from a Amazfit Bip so this is a nice upgrade.My wife has an Apple Watch 3, I would not trade it for this watch, the battery life, price range and functionality are much better.Very happy with it!"
Amy Rether,"Battery life boasted 21 days however mine lasts 5. Other than that  love the look, love the feel and the features!!"
Gemless Ear,"I have been in tech for over 30 years so connecting via Bluetooth should be very easy, not with this watch/software.  Also no phone support, wait a few days for an e-mail.  Returning this watch without ever getting a chance to use.  Purchase only if you are willing to be frustrated."
Kristin,"This smart watch works better than the Fitbit that I had. The battery and app is 100 times better. I did have 2 problems with the watch when I first purchased it. 1) the band irritated my wrist, purchased a new band and all is well.2) I had to factory reset twice because the heart rate monitor stopped working. It's been good ever since. I still love this watch and would recommend buying it."
Kristin,"I normally don't write reviews however after owning this product for about a month now I must say it's AMAZING. Lets start off by saying I am a Apple fan so buying this was a concern. I am an outdoors kind of guy who likes a variety of activity. I was on the fence between apple watch and the GTR. It does all that's needed and then some for 1/2 the price. If you are looking to send messages from your watch and you have a iphone,  allegedly you can't do that. Other then that , I read messages, download music, use health monitor and get to customize my screen. BUY IT IF you are on the fence, you will NOT regret it."
Shanna,"Build quality is better than expected, I'm impressed, it went through 20 % of battery in two days! My previous one had to be plugged in every 12 hours"
Shanna,The Battery Life on this watch is ridiculous.  I don't even know how long it lasts.  I charge it once a week.  This has the standard features.  Easy to upload music.  The watch doesn't always stay connected to my phone..  but the battery life is so good that I almost don't care about anything else!
Derik Rossi Teixeira Melo,I have an Apple Watch series 7 and a Tag Connected. the Apple eco system is almost impossible to beat. The quality of the Connected is as you'd expect from Tag. I have had this for two days and it's still at 93% without taking it off. The faces are gorgeous. if you want a beautiful smart watch and don't need all that apple gives you this is hands down the best watch. I already ordered my second one
Derik Rossi Teixeira Melo,It really is a great watch but as far as using ALEXA It works about 20% of the time. I have written to customer service and they never answer.  Horrible customer service
H. Drallmeyer,"When I first received the watch, even the quality of the box felt SO premium and I immediately felt in love with the design. I changed the strap right away and it is definitely one of the most beautiful smartwatches I‚Äôve ever seen. I was so excited and then became so disappointed when I started charging the watch and saw that the screen was defective and had a white line. I‚Äôm still deciding if I will purchase it again because honestly, for $249 you could also get an Apple Watch SE with the guarantee of the quality and same or even more features.Lastly, the app is great for sleep tracking, HR, steps, etc. But for strength training is not the best and it is also not very intuitive."
H. Drallmeyer,"I hear bibs on my watch when I was in the shower; next, a message showed out of battery - for this case returned. The second time I didn't pay attention to that, but I realize the screen was frozen and I couldn't syn because was not connected. after trying many things I reset to factory (I hold x 15 seconds for the 2 only bottoms); reset to factory, reinstalled the app, and connected back."
Armando D√≠az,It has a very nice screen and good battery life. You can also play music and answer calls with it.But the sleep tracking doesn't work sometimes.
Javier B,"Great look, quality is awesome , battery life is good  , nice sport tracker, i recomend it"
baby girl,Battery life is excellent
Falcon,"I love that watch looks good on the wristIt is important to know that this is an independent operating system of amzfit and therefore the number of applications is very limitedThe more animations on the clock you choose, the shorter the battery life will be and if you turn on the heart rate monitor and the oxygen in the blood, the battery will be reduced."
Falcon,"Sleep tracker is off, it does not detect all sleep and def does not properly track awake times. Put 1300 steps on my watch when I got up in the middle of the night, it said I had a perfect sleep with no awake times. Another time I was awake for an hour before it detected I woke up. It has said I was asleep while simitaniusoly was swimming, I was asleep. It has also said I was sleeping while at work.The get up an move every 12 hr thing is wrong as well. Actively out walking while using the activity log and it tells me I have been sitting too long and I need to get up and walk.The temperature thing is not what was implied it does outside temp, yet it still has a weather ap, but the temp thing is wrong only says 86-88 degrees regardless of what it actually is.Step thing is not accurate, I have not figure out what percentage of accuracy it is yet, seems inconsistent.It does not record breathing correctly, you can hold your breath or you can hyperventilate and it still says 15-18 breaths a minute.Stress level indicated is bogus as well, during a full blown panic episode it says you are calm.The watch face itself is LARGE, I have large wrist and it is nearly wider than my wrist, however it is more comfortable then the Fitbit I had.it does detect when it is fully submerged in water, but it doesn't stay tracking swimming it cuts in and out or logs hours of swimming when you didn't.I am sure a lot of other features don't work correctly as well."
Alexander L.,I am hard on watches.  This is my first watch that was over 40 bucks and it has been amazing.  Very tough.  Only thing thats annoying is the constant notification on your phone that the watch is connected.
JTC,"I actually splurged and bought a smart watch. In reality I find the only use for it is tracking my walks and exercise. Having Alexa on my watch is dumb because it has to be connected to my smartphone so why not just use the smartphone to tell Alexa to do something. Also the sleep monitor is a joke. Every time you move it lights up, totally annoying. I could have just paid about half or less and got a exercise tracking watch. Well I guess I made a bad choice for me."
Amy Rether,"Llego en perfecto estado, y ha funcionado correctamente"
Crys,"I find it very good in monitoring sports training. GPS works very well. I'm not so sure about the other sensors. In daily use I am getting up to 6 days of use with sleep monitoring and heart rate monitoring every 5 minutes, also with a cycling workout once a week."
Edwin Campos,"The physical watch is great, lightweight and looks and feels quality.The nurse said graphics are outstanding, crisp, clear and easy too read.The speaker and microphone work well. The Alexa feature works fairly well, but can only respond on screan.The cons-I don't see any way, with normal use to get thebattery to last more than 4, maybe 5 days. The upside ls it does charge back up surprisingly fast.The functions 95 pecent sports tracking. And very little health tracking, which as Septagenarian I find lacking.The Zepp interface app works well but could be more user friendly.There is a selection of watch faces (not hundreds) many just Varients of each other, not impressive.My conclusion isThis watch could be a great watch when (I hope) firmware & software updates catches to the watch's potential."
dante jaramillo,This watch is great. The only thing I found that it has some problems with is the sleep and nap data. Some mornings it is correct and some it didn't even catch that I was napping or sleeping. But I still would definitely recommend. I wish it had payment options like others but it's ok. Maybe they will make it possible one day so I can pay in stores.
jim g.,This smart watch has great battery life. Getting almost 2 weeks one one charge. Make sure to download AmazFaces for more watch faces. The few issue I had was at first I wasn‚Äôt receiving all notifications. The app would not even show all the apps on my phone to allow notifications. After a few hard resets it started to work. The other annoying thing is that is veryLimited on locations for weather and because  this your location could be off by cities. This needs to be addressed by Amazfit. This not a smart watch for small wrist.
Skylor K.,There is nothing about this watch that I don't like. Everything about this watch is perfect for me.
Marco,"I love the watch for its price, but it has a kind of plastic cheap feeling. No hebrew support, and some stop watch issues.The app is a little confusing and not that user friendly, but again for the price its a bargin"
kobi,Love this watch.  Being able to set custom vibrations for different types of notifications is great.  Step tracker is accurate and being able modify the ending mileage after a treadmill run in case it gets off is a nice touch.  The only thing it is missing is being able to send a reply text.  Hopefully that comes to iphone users eventually.
Luis Cruz,"So far day 3 of use and I'm impressed. It is fantastic looking, excellent battery life and great fitness tracking. The Zepp app is a much better compared to Apple Health app. The watch looks sleek and polished. Beautiful. The fitness tracking seems accurate. It had sleep analysis which natively is missing from the Apple Health app. So all this is a great alternative to Apple Watch for iPhone users. Zepp app has a huge collection of watch faces. These are all free."
Dan,"Overall, I'm satisfied with this product and I'm happy I purchased it. It works as described. I wish it was able to detect steps when using a walker, but I'm happy with it."
Cesar Moreta,Excelente
JTC,"Nice watch, amazing potential. Does not work with Tattoos . Heart rate monitor and other functions do not 'read' through tattoos. After hours of trouble-shooting, restarts, factory defaults, app re installs, CS etc...turns out my watch does not work well because of my tattoos.**Buyer Beware** If you have tattoos on your sleeve, it is not worth the price of the watch."
Amy Rether,"Es muy f√°cil de usar, muy intuitivo. Su apariencia es muy bonita y tiene todas funciones necesarias para hacer deporte y controlar signos vitales. Aunque hubiera sido mejor si Alexa funcionara en Colombia."
Darin Bradley,"La bater√≠a f√°cilmente me puede durar las dos semanas. La pantalla ya se ray√≥ pero bueno, dur√≥ bastante sin hacerlo y resisti√≥. Muy buena compra. En internet hay muchas webs y aplicaciones para agregar faces personalizadas, recomiendo mucho este smartwatch."
Sal,"Wow, I was a Garmin user and decided to change since the battery lasted only 1 day.This monster fully connected and synchronized with my phone, charged to 100%, day 4 it's 94%.During the night it only took 1% of the battery.This watch is amazing. Higly recommended."
Zachary Thraen,Great watch so far I like it a lot The watch works really good I really like it and it is pretty nice watch not sure if I should‚Äôve got the pro or not but I know the pro was more money but it does a couple a little more features who knows maybe down the road
cougar56,"The is well made, it tracks sleep very well and very good battery life"
Pfn,"I love this watch. Long battery life, lots of apps, tracks alot of stuff. Big face and easy to read, Very comfortable watch band. I would recommend to anyone."
RCS2011,"I realllllly want to leave a better review for this watch. Works underwater, great battery, excellent sport settings and scanners, and is pretty cool overall. But I cannot for the life of me get the phone to keep a static BT connection to make calls with my last phone, and my new Pixel 6 cannot even get to that point. The camera BT button does not work either. I purchased this product specifically for the ability to talk into my wrist like a secret agent. :) I hope I can find a work around, because I have had it to too long to return. :("
Bryant Hayward,"I loved this watch when I first saw it, and wore it for a couple of weeks. I loved how big the screen was, and all the cool things I could do with it. Then it started unpairing just because. I would simply pair it again, but the main reason why I wear a smart band is to keep my cell phone in silence. After some days, one morning my cell phone (Xiaomi) had only 5% batt when I woke up, and by the next day I had needed to recharge it at least 3 times. I tried deleting the app, cleaning cach√©, reinstalling, but the problem persisted. Even uninstalling the app the batt would end sooner than before. Then I reset the phone to factory settings and checked it was working well. Once I confirmed that, I reinstalled the app. It started draining the app after an hour. So now I'm back at my xiaomi smart band, and I will stick to it. And this expensive watch is just sitting there. I don't even want to sell it because I don't want anyone to experience the same issues."
mauricio ramriez almeciga,"Pese a ser mi primer reloj de este tipo, me parece buen reloj, no presenta fallas, alta durabilidad de la bater√≠a y todo lo ofrecido lo cumple a cabalidad."
Gigi,Love my GTR 3Pro. The battery life is what does it for me. It sometimes miscalculate my steps however I‚Äôm willing to overlook that. It does a great job letting me know how little sleep I am getting and keeping me on track of my fitness goal. This is definitely a keeper.
Gigi,This watch is the answer to a round faced smart watch that apple does not sell. Only problem I‚Äôve had is staying synced to the iPhone. The description says that it has its own network connection so why the need to connect to the phone to get weather updates?
Turtleman,"Impressive and elegant. I don't care passes, meters to climb mountain neither run a marathon, not at all. Just get connection with my cell phone. Hour, day, date, battery, weather, messenger, WhatsApp, news, calls, etc."
JTC,I am enjoying  every  bit of things that I have so far known about the this cute watch.
Amy Rether,I got it for the GPS to keep track of different walking routes for a better accurate idea of distance & calorie burn. First time owning a smart watch of any kind & I am not at all disappointed. And the battery life is amazing.
John B. Sherrill,"Happened to check my heart rate jokingly after me and the wife ‚Äúexercised‚Äù‚Ä¶ and pulse was a high of 136BPM and I hit the aerobic range for 1 minute‚Ä¶ seems like this watch is pretty accurate if you ask me, the wife agreed to!"
Kimbo,My girl be wearing all the time she be happy about all it offers.
Angelo,This was a gift for husband
Angelo,Como se pueden cargar canciones desde un iphone? Una de las ventajas que le veia a este reloj era el poder correr con musica y sin el telefono. Pero no se puede. Si alguien sabe como aviseme.
Rudo Trotman,I have tried many different smart watches but this one seems to surpass all the others.  Does everything it says plus so much more which will probably take me a year to figure out.  Very happy with this purchase!!!
Rosie,It‚Äôs a cool watch. Clearly leans heavily towards Android users. The navigation/gps part of the watch doesn‚Äôt work for iPhone. Huge let down. The music app sucks portion sucks too. It‚Äôs cool though and works for what I need.
Amazon Customer,This is a very good watch. You really don‚Äôt need to do much besides wear it and it tracks everything that you need. The reading seem very accurate and battery life is pretty good. Great value
Amazon Customer,"I got the watch for 10 days now and still got 35% of battery life.The watch is light and the screen is bright enough that you can view all the details under bright sunny sky.The watch comes with a lot of activities such as running , swimming , elliptical,  treadmill.I could also store music on the watch and listen it without your phone while joggingHealth tracking featuring BP , O2 and stress measurement is also available if one needs to measure them.The Zepp app is easy to setup and use"
Anisley,"Pros:  Gorgeous amoled big screen.  Very bright indoor and readable outdoors.Great battery life.  Very customizable.  Over a hundred watch faces.  The phone app is very intuitive and customizable, easily the best phone app.Con:  Only con, wish there were more always on watch faces."
Michael S. Stark,You can actually make calls but when someone calls me that number will remain on screenThe dial icon don't show anymore üòîHow can I fix this?
Mike V.,Desde hace ya muchos a√±os siempre he comprado estos relojes para realizar deportes y esta marca nunca me ha dejado descontento. Siempre lo que publican funciona a la perfecci√≥n.Gracias
JTC,The battery doesn‚Äôt stay more than five to six days mostly
Amy Rether,"Works really well, I'm about to track all my steps, runs as well as the length of time spent in calorie burning zones during my workouts."
TG,Muy resistente la bater√≠a üîã de larga duraci√≥n
