Grace,"My review is based on observations after one month of ownership. I'm not a typically active person, so I don't need to monitor my exercises, but I really like the statistics about my body (sleep, bpm, etc.). I owned a simple health monitor and decided to upgrade to a decent start watch with the parameters I need. I tried 2 other brands of watches (AmazeFit and Huawei) but they didn't meet my expectations. I was skeptical about this watch because I don't see many products of Garmin to be popular.Anyway, my watch arrived and I was pleasantly surprised with its appearance, the app and its menus are not perfect I would admit, but one could manage to get to the point that what is displayed on the screen is acceptable. One very annoying thing that was the most apparent from the get-go is the alarm, it rang at 6 AM, and though the screen suggests that the top button will turn it off and the bottom will snooze it, in reality, both buttons could only snooze the alarm, so after a couple of irritating hours with 30 snooze cycles I contacted Garmin Customer Support at around 1 PM. At this time I felt that I would like to return the watch, but since I've returned 2 other watches I really wanted this one to work so I could stop researching what to buy and learn a new manual every 2 weeks.  Customer service was helpful but instead of resolving the canceling and snoozing the alarm I got to the point where I could turn off the alarm from the clock menu with the only caveat that later you have to remember to turn the alarm back on or it work the next time. I did reset the watch and charged it completely as the CS person suggested, but nothing changed. At this point, I wanted to give it 3-4 more days to see how I feel with the device and I was determined that most likely I will return the watch. A couple of days later by mistake, I figure out that if I hold the touch screen with a moist finger (it works around 40% of the time with a dry finger) and then press the top button the alarm will turn off, so I finally thought that I have a watch that I would use in the next couple years because I got used to it.Unfortunately, after more than one month (1 month and 3 days), I noticed that my watch has paint chips already, so I don't like it as much anymore :) I'm not very active, I'm an engineer that mostly writes on a computer, I didn't put this device on a test, instead it was cover under my sleeves and turns out that the black coating on the metal is not galvanized but painted instead and the paint could come off easily. I don't know how much more durable the other watches are, but I don't find this very acceptable, but I have to stick with the device since I passed the window for return with 3 days. I guess the paint will continue stripping until it becomes a white metal watch with a black strip.In the end, I would say if you're going to use this watch in the woods only and don't care about aesthetics and how this device will look (look at the picture), this is a great watch. If you think you need a sleek smartwatch on your wrist during the day, I would suggest otherwise."
Victor Organa,"I had a Samsung Gear S3 for 3 years before buying this watch. The S3 was a good watch, but so many of the fitness functions were flawed. It had poor GPS tracking so my runs would come out with shortened distances, and even though it had weights and other workouts, I couldn't build a full workout program.After watching many video reviews, I decided to switch to the Garmin Venu 2. The build quality is great and the watch is actually a little slimmer and lighter than the Samsung. I found that Garmin had several different coaching programs so I started one for a 5k. I've been working through it for 2 months now and I'm really enjoying it. It does a great job of pushing me hard enough, but giving me recovery time to get stronger. I haven't been able to run this well in a long time so it's really a great feeling. On top of that, I built my own custom 3 day split for weights. When starting a weight workout, it shows my first exercise, amount of weight, and how many sets and reps. It counts the reps as best it can although some movements don't involve your watch arm so it will be off. You click a button to end the set and it starts the rest countdown that you set up in your program while also giving you a simple menu to adjust the amount of reps and the amount of weight that you did on that set. Tracking the rest time is awesome and keeps me from getting distracted and off pace. It's a fantastic companion for weight lifting and I'm really enjoying having it.The battery life is simply awesome. I'm tracking either weights or a run almost every day and I'm getting 9 days of battery life between charges. My Samsung watch started at about 3 days of battery life and has decreased over time to about a day and a half. It does have a proprietary plug so I have to be careful not to lose the cord. USB C would have been nice, but Garmin has been using this plug for a long time so it is easy to find replacements online.I've paired wireless headphones to the watch (Samsung Buds) and I listen to Spotify. They work great and don't have any drop outs.I'm a big fan of having a lot of complications on my watch face so I can get a lot of information with a quick glance. The default watch faces were just okay, but Garmin has a store with more options. I'm currently using a free one called ""Clear and Powerful"" and I'm obsessed with it. It has a nice clean style while still providing a ton of data (in addition to the time I have date, sunrise/sunset, steps, floors, battery, altitude, temp, and moon cycle).Sleep tracking is great and very accurate. It is useful information and they pair it with a body battery meter that shows how rested and ready for workouts you should be. There are lots of other graphs and tracking that it does for heartbeat, oxygen, and breaths per minute. It's all well laid out and not overwhelming.There are a few small drawbacks. There's no speaker or microphone on the watch so you can't take calls directly from it. You also can't activate an assistant. Besides those specific areas, the watch shows me all of my notifications and I can see and use canned replies to texts. I almost always want to use my phone for any real replies so this is fine for my needs. I did have a few times in the past when I took a call on the Samsung watch. It was convenient, but again, not a deal breaker for me to not have it as I'll answer the call on the Buds or on the phone itself. The watch will still show who is calling and allow me to decline or answer from the watch.So over all, a really great watch. The smart watch features are enough to cover making sure you don't miss calls, texts, and notifications, and provide a lot of data on the watch face. The battery life is amazing and it's really nice to know I could go on a trip and not even have to worry about charging it for the entire time. The running coach is very good and the weights workout creator is easy to use, but very rich in features. Anyone serious about fitness should take a strong look at this watch."
Victor Organa,"2 weeks now using this watch. I am very happy. Very good purchase.I exercise every day and all the features available in the watch suit me very well.I do weightlifting, bike, running and other fitness workouts.All statistics are awesome. They are very easy to follow, show a complete status of what the sensors measure over time, and for a long period without charing. So far, around 8 days with full monitoring sensors.The watch is large enough look good and also show large numbers and all the graphs in a good way.Thanks!"
Victor Organa,"The first venu 2 I bought, no activities were tracking, heart rate could never be detected. After some digging on the net, I found it's a pretty common problem. I tried factory reset, regular reset, all the tricks listed, but nothing changed. I ended up exchanging it, and this one works great! Exchange was super easy, Amazon was great with that.My new venu 2 tracks activities, the GPS works awesome, exactly what I wanted!"
Grace,"I'm coming from a Samsung Gear s3 Frontier watch that I have been using for 2.5 years.  The experience on that watch was slowing getting worse.  It was getting very laggy and the battery was starting to die quickly.  It served me well, however.  In my pursuit of a new watch, I almost didn't even look at Garmin.  I was figuring I'd upgrade to a newer Samsung watch.  I'm glad I took the time to research and try a Garmin.I'm a techie and quasi-athlete.  In other words, I like gadgets and cool tech, and I take exercise somewhat seriously.  I'm not a hardcore athlete or daily runner by any means.  I was originally looking heavily at the Garmin Forerunner 740.  It had a lot of cool features and health tracking data for me to nerd over.  One thing I didn't care for was the lack of a touch screen and some health and exercise features were probably overkill for my needs. Enter Venu 2.ProsThe Venu 2, in my opinion, is the perfect balance between a modern smart watch (like a Samsung or an apple watch) and a health tracker.  It has a beautiful, bright color touch screen, and an intuitive user interface.  Coming from the Samsung gear there are two main things that I noticed.  1. ) The weight is significantly lighter on the Garmin.  Noticeably.  2.) The battery life on the Garmin is amazing.  My Samsung needed to be charged every night.  That meant no sleep tracking for me.  It's weird, but awesome to not have to worry about battery for days on end.  It's a game changer in my opinion.  How Garmin pulls that off on a lighter watch, I have no idea.Garmin obviously is one of the best in the business when it comes to health tracking.  I've found to the stats to be pretty accurate.  I have noticed, that exercising on my elliptical, the calories burned is under reported on the watch, but that can be adjusted after the fact in the Garmin Connect app.  Otherwise, health tracking is great. Have respiration and oxygen saturation stats are cool features I didn't have before.  I also like the body battery feature.  On to the app.  The Garmin Connect App is one of the nicest looking health tracking interfaces I've seen.  Samsung health has gotten cluttered and sometimes it's hard to find historical data. The Garmin app interfaces is beautiful and motivating.ConsThe Venu 2 is not without it's faults.  I think it could have a better build quaility, particularly on the glass.  My Samsung after 2.5 years didn't have a scratch on it.  My Venu, scratched on day 1.  I was not pleased.  I have since learned that they do sell screen protectors for the Venu 2 which I would highly recommend.  Also, on Amazon, Asurion insurance is only about 30 bucks which covers screen damage.  Anyway, for $400, I feel like Garmin could use higher quality glass that is more resistant to scratching.  They could also raise the outer bezel just a bit, to make that a more prominent contact point over the screen.  This is where I dock the Venu 2 just 1 star.  I do also wish that Garmin Connect allowed for more third party integration.  My Withings scale for example.  It would be nice if these companies would allow some back and forth with health data.  But I get why they do it.Would I buy it again?  Absolutely.  I love this watch so far.  The weight, the battery life, the interface, the tracking, and the app are all fantastic.  I recommend it with the one caveat of protecting it with a screen protector and possibly insurance."
Guilherme Zardo Selbach,"My objective hadn't been to buy a smart watch...I'd used a Garmin Vivofit for years to monitor my heart rate while exercising on machines that communicated with it at the gym. However, I wanted to broaden my exercise routine; a broadening that would take me away from the machines. So, the objective was to get a device that would communicate with my Polar chest band while exercising. Objective accomplished; and, BOY, did I ever get much more!Having never worn a smart watch, I'd never paid much attention to them. They'd seemed like just another gadget that I really didn't need. However, now that I have it, I really love the convenience of being able to catch much of what my phone brings me on my wrist.As one who'd used the Gamin android app and website to monitor my exercise regimen for quite awhile, the Venu 2's ready interface with both app and website seemed like a natural fit. I was right about that.At the moment, I'm using it daily to record and log my workout results, and it's a very convenient way of staying on top of communications that are coming into me; both text and email. I also like the little prompts it gives to get moving and breathe deeply when stressed. Moreover, it's something of a comfort when I see it congratulate me for having passed whatever goals it's monitoring for me.The battery life is amazing. I haven't pushed it to its limit, but extrapolating what I see in the way of daily power loss, I'm pretty certain that I'd get well over a week's use before having to plug it in. I also like the easy interface with the Garmin app on my PC when I plug it in. It appears as an additional drive, capable of accepting firmware updates and communication with the app while it recharges.Never one to walk around listening to music, I've not yet loaded my iTunes library into it. Nor do I use it to take phone calls via ear buds. Perhaps I'll start using those features down the road; but, at least for the time being, my phone seems perfectly adequate for that.My wife says that she wishes it had a bit of a slimmer profile, but I don't find it all that different in that respect from many men's watches.All in all, though, I'm very pleased with the Venu 2. It accomplishes exactly what I meant for it to do...and much more!"
Guilherme Zardo Selbach,A full recharge can sustain several dayd
Deven R.,Easy to manage your daily activity & manage your health.
Curtis S,"I have (had) many Garmin and Samsung watches over the last 6 years, including the fenix series.I go back and forth on fitness/battery and smartwatch/pretty screen. Venu 2 corrects the pretty screen and battery life is excellent. With 30 minutes of GPS per day and typical settings, text and email notifications, Sp02 turned OFF, I could easily go 6 days. But my typical pattern is use it for 3 to 4 days and charge when it's under 50%. Takes 30 minutes to charge in 50% battery scenario. Battery charging time is around an hour and very fast to 90%.New interface with glances is basically awesome. The old way of swiping through every widget is cumbersome and was one thing I love about Samsung with the physical dial, to quickly scroll through widgets.  The glances are more like scrolling a web page and clicking a link and it makes total sense.I exercise regularly. I have used the typical routines many times. Run, Walk, Cardio, Bike, treadmill, they all work about the same as any previous units. I do like pairing to HR monitor for the HIIT, weightlifting, cardio, but not always. Heartrate accuracy is probably a little better than previous units, but it clearly still gets lost and can be slow to respond on cardio, HIIT and for sure on upper body weightlifting. If it makes you mad and it's not recording your Intensity Minutes because of it, pair it with a chest strap. It's the only way. : - )One thing is for sure, Garmin will ALWAYS be recording something for HR. My Samsung watch will sometimes record HR, stops, starts again, and then estimates the calories based on an algorithm with very little input from intensity or HR.I do love Garmin for the App, the way it tracks calories, and weekly intensity goals. It might overestimate calorie burn a little during workouts, but you won’t get too much extra credit for just being active otherwise during the day.I have taken the “My Day” snapshot a few times. I have been notified my “Fitness Age” is dropping. These are new items on the Venu 2. Probably a little gimmicky, but I am sure it’s a good selling point for some.  I do wish Garmin would add the advanced exercise options from the fenix or forerunner series. I don’t like digging through a bunch of menus to find my VO2 Max. That should be a glance! It makes no sense, and the competitors are putting the V02 Max and other advanced running information front and center now.Last, and maybe the most important for many. Smartwatch. I do have an amazon prime account so it's nice to get that music on the unit ""for included price"". I realize many have Spotify, but I don't, so Amazon Music is nice for me. Although, I don't listen to music while exercising often. The notifications are bare minimum just like what pops up on the phone. It's Garmin, it's how it's always been and it's not the greatest if you want to interact with apps. You can respond with canned responses, but I really like my Samsung and interacting directly with text app and email app from watch. I just get tired of charging the Samsung."
Curtis S,"After months of research and buying a Galaxy 4 classic and sending it back because of short battery life, I finally decided on the Venue 2 because of its long battery life, music capabilities and less than $300."
RobertW,"More than a watch, it is an essential addition to your health.  The screen is so readable and bright.  Such crisp definition.  Connects easily with sensors.  I had to google some of the more advanced functions.  If only it could make coffee."
Pik K.,"I previously had a Forerunner 645 and It broke. I love this watch so much more. It is touch screen but it doesn’t interfere with anything. Perfect watch for hiking, weight lifting, running, walking."
Bill Marsh,"Ok, so first things first. Ive had 3 different Garmins over the years from the Forerunner 405 to the Fenix 5s Sapphire. I'm an athlete, but want both components of a smart watch and a fitness watch.I switched to an Apple Watch 7 last year as like most people, Apple is now in the blood. However, I've never been completely satisfied the fitness components of the apple watch. But, Its amazing for ease of use and smart watch functionality.So, I thought Id give the Venu 2 a chance. VERY disappointed.  Its almost like Garmin havent given any thought to what smart watch users need, regardless of fitness requirements. Menu navigation is very cumbersome, screen functionality is labored.Returning the Venu, which I am very disappointed in having to do."
Darcy,"I love my watch BUT the instruction booklet wasn't great so I didn't know you had to download a separate app to get different watch faces, or exactly how the workouts work (the app has A LOT of features and is not intuitively organized). The step tracking seems accurate BUT the mileage my watch says I've done based on steps is pretty inaccurate. GPS calibration didn't work well and I've had the thing for more than a month and just found there's a custom stride length you can input which still needs some dialing in but the mileage is getting closer. This involves a lot of playing with it and trial and error. I wouldn't say it's out of the box ready unless you're familiar with Garmin devices, but it is an excellent watch with lots of tools that you can choose to include or not."
Keith Allen,I bought this for my son as a gift and he totally loves it. He is an avid gym goer and uses it every single day.
Grace,"This is the 4th ""Smart"" watch for me . All pretty much have the same flaw , they may do one thing well but they are all very inaccurate .  I caught myself fixating on ""measured ""parameters . I was a heart rate junkie , SO2 junkie , a rem junkie and so on. I understand trying to achieve health goals and the watches may help but only in the sense they are toys and only as smart as the user .  All watches warn against basing anything on the data they measure . About the only thing I liked was changing faces and the ""Dick Tracey"" novelty. I submit a new name .  ""Toy Watches"""
Victor Organa,"This is a high end smart watch with all the bells and whistles.  Skiing, golf and workouts are features I use often on this watch.  Very accurate in all aspects.  Sometimes I feel like the sleep tracking is off but who knows.  The battery will last for days when not using GPS.  Will last almost a full day in nonstop GPS.  This is by far the best smart watch I have owned. Outclasses the apple, samsung and fitbit models in and above this price point.  No brainer."
Stoney,"I had a Samsung Watch 4 classic.  The screen is great.  The features are great, but when battery life is ~26 hours for basic features, and it takes more than an hour to charge, i'm waiting for my watch every day.My replacement is this Venu 2.  The screen is just as good, and battery life is about 5 days.  If I charge the watch when getting ready for work in the morning, the battery never runs out. I don't wear my Samsung watch anymore.One feature that Garmin should add is an FDA approved heart monitor.  With that feature, the Samsung watch would never sell."
aegentry712,Pros:- Battery last at least a week with normal use; charges really fast (main reason I chose Garmin watch over others)- Lots of data tracking- Comfortable to wear all day and during sleep- Customizable watch faces from the Connect IQ app- Can receive text/email messages from android phoneCons:- Doesn't come with a wall outlet charging adapter (have to use one from another watch or phone)- Occasional syncing issues; seemed to happen after installing the Connect IQ app; they should just integrate the Connect app and Connect IQ app together- Doesn't let you enter body fat %; relies on BMI for fitness age- Doesn't sync with common cardio equipment so it doesn't automatically track distance/speed/etc- Floors climbed tracking isn't accurate
KSS133,"I love the ease of use, comfort and versatility of this watch. It also give’s recommendations on how to improve your sleep etc. tracks routes, don’t need phone when downloaded Spotify songs to watch. You can listen offline and without the need of your phone."
Alyssa,"I’ve purchased and used 3 fitbit watches and an Apple Watch - all primarily for tracking daily steps.Fitbit?  The display is consistently a piece of crap.  When I went out in the sun, I simply couldn’t read it at all.  Aside from that?  Meh.Apple Watch for tracking distance?  It has way to much unnecessary and “un-watch” oriented junk on it.Multipurpose works in many scenarios - but an Apple Watch is like a blender combined with a tv set, combined with a toothbrush - or something.Amyway, this Garmin watch is super fantastically amazing.  It’s easy to read, has GPS for tracking my routes, syncs really quickly, and has a bunch of features exclusively focussed on health.Get it!"
Inez Gomez,"There are several things I like about this watch, but ultimately I've been disappointed.The sleep tracking is pretty good.  I also like the HRV measuring and stress monitoring.Having said that, the battery life is truly awful, and I'm not even streaming music or some of the other thing that drain the battery.  A full charge lasts maybe 2 days.Secondly, the Garmin proprietary charging cord is a deal breaker.  It ought to be USB C or at least micro USB so that when it does run out of battery and I'm at the office or in the road I can use some sort of USB cable to recharge it.  Instead I have to buy separate Garmin cables for work or travel.Also, the Garmin charging cable is genuinely awful.  It has trouble staying attached to the watch.  Any slight movement or misalignment and the charging cord comes unplugged from the watch.  Plenty of times I have picked my watch back up from charging only to find it had slightly dislodged from the connector, so it was still not charged.Also, the Garmin app ecosystem is pretty terrible.  Much worse than I expected.Finally, the watch face has gotten scratched easily during normal daily activities.  I'm not talking about taking it rock climbing and it got scratched.  I'm talking about wearing it around the house and ar work and somehow there are two big scratches on the face.In short, if the charging cable was USB C and actually stayed attached to the watch while charging, and if I could get batter life something like a week, or close to it, I would have a much higher opinion of this watch.  A better app ecosystem would also help tremendously."
Jess Jennings,I had a Fitbit Versa 2. I liked it. Was planning on waiting for the Pixel Watch but I saw this on sale for Prime day. Not disappointed at all. Works like a smart watch and has all the benefits of a Garmin fitness unit. No regrets. The only thing I did not like was the band material. The silicone band beat the crap out of my wrist. Bought some different material bands and it's how healing.
Kelly Acton,Excelent
Nema,"Venu 2 is a really decent sports watch with not great but reasonable smart watch features. Music, notifications, quick text reply, all work quite well on Venu 2 but no speakers and mic is kinda a bummer given the price tag.Garmin has one of the very best biometrics tracking algorithms so no real complaints there. Sleep scores and body battery features seem accurate as I do feel more tired after a bad night sleep and that reflects on the sleep score and body battery recharge.The screen is gorgeous and the touch control is perfect, but gorilla glass is definitely not as scratch resistant as sapphire.  I waited a while before purchasing because I was hoping Garmin would launch a sapphire version.  Battery life is decent.  I get 4 days out of it with adaptive brightness, all day heart rate, sleep tracking, total of ~2 hours of GPS tracking exercises, and total of 3 to 5 hours of indoor exercises like weight lifting or basketball. And when I recharge there usually is abt 20% battery left.  This of course is not as good as coros watches but to me it's totally acceptable.The Garmin connect app is OK but can definitely use some tweaks.  For example I found it really confusing to have 2 different ""user setting"" tabs. One is for gender, age, height, weight etc, the other has the same stuffs with extras like hydration targets, daily activity levels, weather locations, first day of the week... Why can't these all be under one ""user setting"" tab?Nonetheless, I think it's a damn good watch and I truely enjoy using it."
Bob,"Tracks my cycling well.Tracks sleep ok but no accommodation for naps, which complete my irregular sleep cycle. Fitbit would include napping if an hour or more.Several unnecessary and silly calculations but you can hide them if you like. Body battery?... It's strong, looks great, good weight.Watch faces are excellent and programmability of many of them is superior, allowing customization of every facet.It responds to wrist wake up 10 time better than Fitbit.Also wakes with quick double tap on screen.Syncing with app has never failed, 15 seconds. One of the main reasons I left the Fitbit behind."
John Zurbriggen,"First of all, this watch weighs nothing. I've had 2 Samsung watches. A TicWatch. A Fossil Smartwatch. Each of them easily weighed 3 times what this Venu 2 weighs.That is a little counterintuitive, given the fact that this battery blows all those other watches away. I'm 2 weeks owning this watch. And I'm still at 55% battery power after only two charges since I received this watch. This watch DOES NOT DRAIN the battery. And let's face it, the first week of any new gadget, and we're all playing, testing, experimenting and generally wearing down the battery. Not this one. I don't know where they store the power in this lightweight watch.I'm still learning the quirks. Like the sleep app tells me I had poor sleep, after it tells me I slept 9+ hours. 🤣Anyway, love this watch. The battery is the best I've ever had. The app is intuitive and engaging. The watch faces available can provide a LOT of info. And I love the pulse-ox feature."
John Zurbriggen,"Not for old people, complicated setup, good quality but not smart as I expected"
Grace,I purchased the Venu as a replacement for my second failed Fitbit Sense and a couple of failed Charges. Two Senses in a row failed in the pool but supposedly waterproof.  Last one just days after 1 year warranty.  Just could not handle any longer their poor quality.  The Venu has all the features of the sense but is truly waterproof and has a few more features not considered premium.  The app is nice and on par with Fitbit. I am a little frustrated with the Venu’s band as the strap end comes loose from the slide holder at times but overall happy with the watch.
Victor Organa,"I got a venu 2. Display, battery life, and connect app are pretty awesome. Bought it to track runs and eventually swims. I personally believe calorie counts are off. I think the watch claims you're burning more calories than you really are. The straps are my least favorite part. I find it uncomfortable especially to sleep with so im not sure how sleep tracking is, did it once. Good news is there's a bunch of different straps you can replace the ones that come with the watch."
BarrySaukee,I have always used the Apple Watch. My wife bought me the Garmin! I absolutely love it. The battery life is unbelievable.
misty denman,"Does nearly everything the Apple Watch does but has a 9-10 day battery life. Looks like a nice watch too, not a small tablet. Far superior sleep and HR tracking than Fitbit. Would like more granular notifications control."
christofer kubetin,"This watch has a big, beautiful display. It is full featured and everything seems to work. The documentation is a little sparse, but covers everything. I am pleased with the watch."
Felipe Albiero,"The screen isn't bright enough to read in bright sunlight with polarized sunglasses. The device works really well, otherwise.  All I want are health functions, swimming, walking and golf. If I can't read the screen in bright sunlight with polarized sunglasses I can't use it."
Zhen L.,"I love garmin watches and have used them for years. This one is visually a pretty nice improvement over my previous Fenix. Its slim, clean, not clunky. The touchscreen works well usually, except when i'm cycling.  The feature set is great on the phone.  Its kind of everything you'd expect from garmin except a few things. The sleep tracking and body battery and stress are great features.Cons1) the battery life is atrocious.  I get about 3 days. I switched watch faces several times to try to rule out it was a watch face problem.2) SP02 monitoring, you can only turn this on, off, or during sleep. You should be able to add this during workouts.3) The workout animation screens seemed novel, I like that you can add your workouts in there.  Some of them even have video for people who need help with form. But you can only add exerizes that they predefined, so if they don't have it or you use a different name you can't add it. They don't even have a good master list of exercises. How hard is it to make a webpage walking people through doing this.4) sleep tracking is kind of outstanding except it always thinks I go to bed about an hour later than I do.5) The SDK seems lame and only related to building watch faces and not apps. If you look at an apple watch they have a great sdk where people build a ton of nice apps. The 3'rd party support for garmin is non existent except for a few people who make watch faces.If the battery life was 7 days I'd love this watch. But with it being charged constantly I'd almost rather have a apple watch at least they have some cool apps you can use."
Zhen L.,"It does everything it says it would. My only complaint is that it disconnects from my phone too often. You'll notice it too when you go on the Garmin Connect app and see that nothing has synced. I've seen it take an hour to finally sync. Nothing ""turning off/on"" Bluetooth won't fix but still a bit annoying."
John Brian Moran,"Depending on what you're looking for on a Garmin, this is your best bet. I have a Forerunner 955 and Epix 2, believe it or not, I'm happier with the Venu 2. Epix is too big and face watch too messy, Forerunner 955 has lots of downsides, including screen. Venu doesn't have all the fitness tracking but for the price, it's the very best you can get, also thar circular watch face is fire. I wish my Epix 2 had it"
KD Matt,Pros - Great watch for tracking fitness and workouts even has a blood oxygen checker. 14 day battery life.Cons - hard to change watch faces. Not user friendly with anything non-garmin.
Nicolas Jullian Urenda,"Bought this watch while it is on sale to replace my 3 years old Vivoactive 3 which battery life seems to be shorter as I need to charge every 2 to 3 days.Pros:- Gorgeous & Vibrant color OLED display and good size watch with excellent real estate and easy to read compare to washed Vivoactive 3 screen.Cons:° Doesn't work right out of the box.  Have to contact Garmin support / forum multiple time and jump through hoops for connection issue through the Mobile Connect app and for the new glance UI where Hydration notification doesn't work.° Battery life is kinda short as I expected it lasts at least a week between charge:- Lasted only 4 days (lost 25% charge / day) with non-running in background 3rd party watch face Crystal. - Only worn12H max day time, no phone / Bluetooth notifications, medium contrast, no gps and any exercising activities other than step counts, time, move reminder.- Display is set to always on but only shows HH:MM and date most of the time.  In contrast, Vivoactive shows all metrics, HH:MM:SS, date, battery life, step counts, distance and with hydration notification.° Curved display, therefore impossible to find a glass screen protection.° USB cable for Vivoactive 3 plugs into Venu 2 won't be recognized in Garmin Express.° Removing / uninstalling widgets from Mobile Connect app and it automatically puts them back in.  Try a few days later and it works out of the blue.For all the cons I experience, I decide to return it."
Michael D,"Got this smartwatch on behalf of a colleague. He has been wearing it for 02 days now and given his IT work, is familiar with tech and value tech items. For the price, this smartwatch is worth it because it is stylish without being too heavy or bulky. Wearing wise, according to him, can hardly notice there is a watch on your wrist but it is felt as barely there (so plus points for lightness). Features wise (he had an Apple Watch) and the only reason he switched was because he got tired of the square look while the features, especially the various monitoring apps, are accurate and helpful. Good overall smartwatch for sporty people who prefer stylish looks (since no need to change watch for dinner/formal events). Vinaka vakalevu Garmin (for the quality product) and Amazon and DHL for the very quick delivery to Fiji."
Jake B.,"Buy this watch if you are active and on the fence between this and the apple watch! It is a no brainer if you train and like metrics. The battery last way longer and it is a watch for active people. That being said, the Sleep tracking and stair climbing just doesn't work. I run the same 100 flight of stairs daily and the watch will only record maybe 30% of them. If you want this watch to accurately measure your sleep or your stair climbs you will be disappointed. They should allow the floors climbed to be adjusted in the app so it reflects in your stats. You can modify it in activities on the app, but it doesn't change the count on the watch or your metrics. Yes, I am splitting hairs. Other than that, the watch works great. Did I mention that if you are active that you should buy this over the Apple Watch?"
Grace,"Awesome watch to keep track of your daily health & more! Heart, sleep, OX, steps, calories & so on. I would absolutely recommend this watch to everyone & hopefully there’s more good & useful updates to come alone!"
Victor Organa,Beautiful watch with nice large watch face. Easy to pair with Garmin Connect app on apple phone. The Garmin IQ app let’s you choose from thousands of watches. The best thing about Garmin is their customer service. They are very responsive and are easy to get an actual person to speak to.
MOMTO3,"1st, the 2 different listed sizes 27.9 mm and 33 mm do not correspond to any apparent physical dimension of the watch. They are perhaps the display size measured by the active pixels, but due to the black on black glass and background it's nigh impossible to identify where the actual display ends.2nd - the size display selections do not function correctly. I purchased a slate/black combo with a size of 27.9 - wanting the Venu 2 S model, however the title of the listing did not change upon my selection of the smaller size (only noticed this after I received the watch and rechecked the Amazon listing), and I therefor purchased the larger Venu 2. Another combo listed as Venu 2 S will show a size selection of 33 mm FYI (light gold/tan).My confusion about the large size of the watch led to my pulling out my digital caliper to see what size the watch really was, and noticing no measurable dimension was either 27.9 mm or 33 mm. To know the actual size of this watch , not the item dimensions listed - the total diameter of the water is either 1.8 inches, or 1.6 inches. which conveniently does not match the metric sizing in the listing selection, and which are also reversed (larger/smaller) from the  description sizing.3rd the language on the watch was set to spanish when I turned it on. For over a decade the standard 1st use of an electronic device is to be prompted for language selection in the initial  set-up, so was I also shipped a used watch?This was a terrible purchase experience. Have fun playing roulette with your purchase."
John Whitford,Has been easy to use and stays charged for a long time.
Catnap,"I switched from Fitbit sense to this and it’s been such an upgrade. I love the UI and app, as well as the fitness features. Not to mention it also looks great and offers a lot of customization. While the sq offers basically everything that this does, you can’t see it on the watch itself. This solves that issue, but I can’t imagine that being worth the price increase to most users. That being said, it’s still excellent, even if it doesn’t do much beyond the much cheaper SQs"
Herb Moses,I use the GPS for MTB. There are better features on more expensive watch but I can accept limitations at this price point.  Watch works well
Terry Hanson,"Short summary: It works and looks decent. Sleek and simple design, now crazy features or buttons. Very decent.The band could be wider for my personal preferrence.Payment works flawlessly.Synchronization with Samsung S21 Ultra without any issues!Battery life won't probably reach the 7-10 days. This is data from my first charge: 4 days, mediocre activity, a few workouts >>> 34 %. Still this is VERY GOOD compared to Samsung or Apple!!! Even my Fitbit didn't last that long.I am overall happy with the purchase."
Danny Hurtado,"I've been a fan of Garmin wearables for quite some time. I've relied on the Forerunner line for fitness tracking and outdoor adventures. My FR945 is great for those, but is a little thin on lifestyle features. The Venu 2 bridges that gap. I can see anything I need to get through the day without the need to open the Connect app on my phone. The touchscreen is bright and responsive. Navigation is intuitive and smooth. I did not feel that the mic/speaker on the Venu 2 Plus would be features that I would use, so I opted for the regular Venu 2 at $100 less. It does not have the navigation capability of my 945, but it is perfect for daily wear, the gym, and local hikes."
Bruno B.,"Holds a batery for about 3 days, looks great. Wont wireless charge."
