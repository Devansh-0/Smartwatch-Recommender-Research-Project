B,"I tried wrist pedometers 10 years ago, they sucked, pretty much all gimmick. Fitbit seems to have upgraded considerably and have the more modest of ""smart"" watches, i dont like a giant bezel on my wrist so this fit the bill more so than the rest. Heart rate looks accurate, step counts are way better than my old surge (it would count steps as i was typing on a keyboard). Activity tracker is pretty cool and convenient. Timer is nice for cooking/meal prep. Calendar reminder is really awesome for keeping me on schedule! The only feature on the versa3 that i find useless is fitbit pay.... None of my financial institutions are accepted. Not really a deal breaker for me, and i did not want to pay an additional $100 for the sense2 to get it. I dont do much with the gps, and turned off all notifications except txt msgs, and calendar reminders, so the battery lasts a solid 6 days"
L. Rice,"I've never had a smart watch before, so this is a new experience for me.  I've owned it over 2 months, and so far so good.  It notifies me via email that my battery is getting low.  It needs recharged around every 5 days.  It doesn't take long to re-charge, but it isn't as fast as my husband's apple watch (20 minutes), however, he has to charge his every day.  I got this to check heart rate while doing some intense walking, and it does what I need it to do.  The fact that it shows me texts from my iphone is a nice bonus."
B,"I bought it after having a stoke and the doctor wanted me to count my steps. I needed to reach 10,000 a day. So glad I purchased it and the premium plan. It has helped change my sleep, made me more aware of my day to day activity. I track my sleep and exercise as well as my water intake and of course my heart rate. I love the relax button to slow my breathing and calm down. I only take it off to shower and charge it.  Absolutely LOVE my Fitbit!"
Mill5,"I have been using Fitbit devices for nearly ten years.  While I have been satisfied over the years my satisfaction has been lessoned over the past 3 years because of a lack of progress with Fitbit devices.  Fitbit devices today are made for people who want to track steps counts through the day and occasionally track a moderate workout.  Current devices are not made for anyone tracking a serious workout.Below are my perceptions of the basic functions of the watch.  Rating each on a 1-5 or NA (Not Applicable) scale.  The reasons for NA to be included are explained.Fitbit Application (4) - The Fitbit App is great.  One consolidated place to track my meals and workouts including everything from activity to corresponding heart rate during the workout.  The only reason it would not get a 5 is that it's only as good as the data it gets, and Fitbit restricts input to only their devices.  There are ways to import data through other integrated apps but none of them get the raw data in its mist useful and meaningful form.  If Fitbit would accept data from other devices, I would be willing to pay for the premium service but that does not seem to be part of their plan.Step Counter (5) - Fitbit is still the king of step counting.  Seems to be the most accurate still although most smartphones can come close.Workout tracking (2) - Tracking is typically a manual task but if the heart monitor detects an elevated heart rate for a period it will attempt to guess what you’re doing.  It can make mistakes and on occasion has detected an hour on the lawn mower as a long bike ride.Stairs (NA) - Fitbit says it can track the number of flights of stairs you have climbed.  I find no evidence that the number of stairs climbed is anything more than a random number generator.  I climb two short flights of stairs daily and have been recorded climbing over 150 flights of stairs on occasion with 75 being a daily average.  Putting the Fitbit device under a common restroom hand dryer can add flights of stairs quickly.  This is not a real measurement.Miles (4) - While this is accurate when walking outside it will track miles for walks internally using step counts and an estimate stride.  Seems pretty accurate but I am not really sure I should be getting miles credited for time spent on a rower.Calories (3) - This seems to be pretty accurate based on the data it has and helps me maintain a deficit of calories.Stress (2) - This seems nice but is a subjective measurement.  I can be in the middle of major problems and it will tell me I have little or no stress.Heart Rate (2) - This is perhaps the most disappointing feature in this device.  Fitbit tracks your heart rate and provides feedback on your heart rate in the form of Zone minutes which assess your daily exercise and activity.  This data is also used to determine your calories burned and how many calories you can consume to reduce or maintain your weight.  This feature works for low to moderate activity.  If you are an active person the Versa 3 will not accurately track your heart rate, not even close.  I had some much trouble getting an accurate reading that made sense that I purchased a Polar H10 with a chest strap to compare data and the results are kind of embarrassing for Fitbit.  I row for 75 minutes on a concept 2 rower with the resistance set to the maximum level (10).  While my H10 shows my heart rate being consistent my Fitbit will show my heart rate as lower, sometimes by 50 beats per minute (bpm).  At these rates you can manually check your own heart rate for comparison to both devices and the H10 is far more accurate.  This would not be a problem except for the fact that the Fitbit app will not accept accurate input from the more accurate device.  For the same workout my zone minutes can fluctuate from 50 to 150 in the same week with heart rate measurements on the H10 that are remarkably consistent.With the less accurate heart rate tracking and the corresponding lower zone minutes the app will record your activity levels as lower and reduce your calorie intake accordingly.  Thus, an inaccurate heart rate literally takes food out of your mouth.  While some might say that allowing you to eat less through this inaccuracy will help you lose weight faster most folks on a diet would still express unhappiness.After 10 years of Fitbits, I have decided to give the Apple Watch a try.  Apple Health and some other applications will accept input from the H10 and the Apple watch.  I can track food intake with MyFitnessPal.  I am hoping these things combined will allow me to meet my goals until Fitbit can either improve their accuracy or allow input from more highly specialized devices.In fairness, I have lost 70 lbs. and kept it off for 5 years and during that time I have been using Fitbit devices, so clearly, I have been successful with Fitbits.  I am hoping that I can move a little father with more accurate data and less frustration."
Yolanda,"The Fitbit APP:I'm pretty technologically efficient. I can mod games, I'm the one who fixes all my friends and families phones and devices when they break. I'm the one people come to app advice and help. And this app frustrated me so much at first. It isn't very user friendly. Setting up the watch and connecting it was so smooth and wonderful! But personalizing the watch (watch faces, apps, settings, etc) was frustrating to figure out. Once I figured it out though, it became super easy and manageable and its easy to read the stats on!Watch:The watch is sturdy, feels good on the wrist and doesn't hurt or get hot. The box comes with a second band that's slightly longer in case you, like me, have a larger wrist! So that was nice! And changing the band was easy once you read the instructions XD. The watch is fast, smooth, and works extremely well. I'm very happy with the functionality I got for the price I paid. Its very very nice and I highly Recommend. The band that comes with it doesn't slip or turn. It looks very sleek and is highly customizable once you learn how to do everything. Very very pleased.The watch gets 5 of 5 stars.The app gets 3 of 5 stars."
L. Rice,"The Versa 3 has an easy to read screen, and navigation through the menus is easy enough.The watch band is not my favorite. The material is 'grippy', and the holes are spaced such that I find myself constantly tightening or loosening the band throughout the day. If I go one notch tighter, the watch becomes uncomfortably tight. If I go one notch looser, the watch slips down resulting in a nagging 'irritation' that something is hanging off my wrist. I have already ordered some replacement bands to try.The magnetic charger is neat. Magnetic polarity prevents incorrect alignment and aids in quick proper alignment. Day three, and the watch still doesn't need charging, showing half-full on the battery meter on the FitBit website. The connecting cord for the charger is irritatingly short. C'mon FitBit; a $230 watch, and you cannot spring for a two-foot cord for the charger?This brings me to my discussion of the FitBit app, website, device setup, etc.First: setup is horrible, worse even. If the device encounters anything it doesn't like during the setup process, you may find yourself stuck in FitBit setup loop.After multiple attempts to setup the device with my phone, then my laptop, then either... add device, delete device, power off everything, wash rinse repeat.I visited the FitBit web site for support, and went into ever-lasting 'hold' awaiting tech support. Meanwhile, I did exactly as they wanted, and spent @ 1/2 hour viewing posts in their forums. I finally found a post that was similar to mine, and the poster provided what was a breakthrough solution for me.Basically, once the FitBit device pairs with a phone, reboots of the phone retain the information. After the first pairing, the info was saved. Subsequent attempts to pair failed ""Pairing rejected by Versa 3"".The solution? On the phone, go to settings, apps, FitBit app, then force-quit the app.Next, uninstall the app, reboot the phone, reinstall the app, then re-pair with the watch.FYI: I have GB internet, and the download of the FitBit took @ 15 minutes each time. Thinking my internet was bad, I tested downloads from other sites, all was well.The setup and configuration process was horrible - so bad, I am holding open my option to return the device within the allotted time frame.The phone app is deeply intrusive; to enable all the features of the FitBit, it needs access to nearly everything on your phone. if you want to use Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexis, your device must be wide open for the FitBit. If you are concerned about privacy, these options are probably a deal breaker.The FitBit Versa 3 is designed for apps. Some apps are free, some cost money. The music feature requires a subscription to a streaming service.I have a decent Motorola phone, and have had no troubles with it - ever. After installing the FitBit app, I have had the phone flake out on me twice so far. I actually had to uninstall and reinstall other apps after installing the FitBit to overcome the issues. And now my phone is using @ 20% more battery, even if I do not intentionally interact with the Fitbit app; it is always running, monitoring everything.Easy to read color display. Many features. Available apps.Crap band. Crap software. Intrusive software. No support. Terrible installation. Slow downloads.Short charger cord.Many features require use of the website or Wifi. Yesterday the ""Find My Phone"" feature worked fine on the watch. Today it was unable to run. I restarted the watch, and it was then able to run.Navigation on the watch's touch screen takes some getting used to. For many menu items, swiping one direction takes you there, swiping the reverse direction may or may not take you back, depending upon how deep you are into the menu, feature, or app.The haptic button on the watch takes a bit of practice to use effectively, and it can be awkward to reach across the watch and get your thumb placed 'just so' to activate this 'non-button, button'.This review is an account of my experiences so far with the FitBit Versa 3. As much as I want to like this device, it is as if FitBit has gone to extremes to make this a challenge.Respectfully submitted."
Wyn,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 My Versa 3 was at 32% battery life when I received it. I plugged it in for the recommended 1 to 2 hours. The first hour I had no charge still so I switched USB ports and let it charge for another hour and the battery life continued to go down. The charging icon doesn't show up. The charging adapter is magnetic and only allows you to attach it to the device one way so it is definitely connected properly.  I am very disappointed, I have had the Inspire 2 for years but its a simple model and the display is difficult to see when outside in the sun. I debated on getting the updated Inspire 3 because they improved that feature but I decided on the Versa 3 because of the smart watch features.I have read reviews with others not being able to charge the Versa 3 having success with aftermarket chargers so I purchased one and will update the review once I receive it. But for now all I can say is it looks like it will be nice but I have it shut off to preserve the battery and havnt used it yet.**UpdateI got my aftermarket charger from Amazon and it charged in less than an hour. At 1pm yesterday it had full battery life and today at 7:45am its at 81%. I use it to track my sleep, log workouts, count calories, and log food so far everything is working very well. I am giving it 4 stars because the hassle I had to go through to get a working charger."
Wyn,This is the Versa-3 which helped in diagnosing my AFib just about a year ago. I'm on now under Doctors Care and monitored quarterly.Looking forward to purchasing the newest versions soon.
CCSWebWeaver,"I used this smartwatch for 2 months before writing this review. I'm a mountain biker and I've been using heart rate monitors for years, mostly the Polar line of watches and chest straps. A few years back I decided to try the first Fitbit Versa, as I wanted to see if a smartwatch could work as a good heart rate monitor during workouts as well. That Versa didn't work, the heart rate was inaccurate and all over the place, so I just kept using my Polar accessories, until this new Fitbit Versa 3 came along.I have tried this Fitbit Versa 3 on rides outdoors and on Spinning sessions indoors, and this is what I've experienced:- Outdoor rides: the GPS works almost flawlessly, the signal gets lost in the woods and around large buildings and large hills, but it comes back to normal quickly. The interface is gorgeous, clean, clear, easy to read, easy to handle during rides, fantastic in general but there's just one big problem, no matter how beautiful and easy to use is this, the heart rate monitor doesn't work. I ride on the same hilly areas all the time, I know how my heart rate behaves in certain hills and roads, up certain steep hills it gets all the way up to 200 bpm, but this watch NEVER once showed that number, it gets to 175 bpm and then it goes blank, the reader cannot handle a faster heart rate, it just goes crazy and stops working, then as I'm climbing the end of the hill it shows a 120 bpm number, which is the heart rate I get when I'm casually walking. Completely inaccurate and all over the place. The maximum heart rate this watch has read during my rides in 2 months is 176 bpm after an uphill that usually makes my heart go up to 200 bpm. After many times of bad readings, I tried both my Polar Ignite and this Versa 3 at the same time during my rides, and the difference was outstanding, the Polar (without a chest strap) was giving me all the right readings flawlessly while the Versa 3 was blank or inaccurate or all over place. All the same problems happened during my running and hiking workouts.- Spinning sessions: during Spinning sessions my heart goes up to 196/ 200 bpm, the Fitbit Versa again got stuck at 170/ 175 bpm and then went blank, and it was giving me bad readings the whole session, always below my actual heart rate, therefore messing up my stats and saying that I burnt a LOT less calories than I actually do. In the photo I'm attaching the Polar Ignite (left) shows my real heart rate and calories burnt during a workout, while the Versa 3 (right) shows the wrong heart rate and the wrong calories burnt, if you see the numbers, they are completely different. I've used this watch for 2 months and tried everything to make it work, all troubleshooting options , but nothing made the heart rate reader work properly.If you take your workouts and stats half-serious, this is not the watch for you, it works fine during casual workouts, like walking or gardening or doing light exercises that won't take your heart over the 180 bpm threshold, once you are higher that that the Versa 3 goes berserk, it cannot read anything faster than that.I'm sticking with my chunky, not-too-cool Polar watches, they may not look as beautiful as the Fitbit products, but they are hard working and completely accurate when it comes to tracking my heart rate, workouts and sports.After wearing this Fitbit Versa 3 smartwatch for 2 months:- The good: AMAZING battery life, about a week or so depending on your settings, beautiful interface, not many apps to use but enough for my usage, as I prefer to use my cellphone for apps in general, light and comfortable to wear, the new strap is cool and comfy, good to track steps, stairs and regular day long activity.Good and accurate GPS without the need for a cellphone. I never used the Alexa option so I cannot comment on that. I tried to respond to my text messages with the voice/dictation option (the watch has a microphone) and didn't work, it may be because I have an accent, who knows, but I think that option is pretty cool. FANTASTIC cellphone app to handle all your info and data.- The bad: AWFUL as a heart rate monitor, awful at sleep tracking, according to this watch I'm a zombie who sleeps 2 hours and has no heartbeat the rest of the night, some nights it won't even track one minute. Yes, I've tried wearing it higher or lower on my wrists, the left one and the right one, none of that made a difference.I hope that at some point Fitbit gets the right technology to make the heart rate reading sensors accurate (like other brands have already done), that'd make it an almost perfect smart watch and real activity tracker. I wish them the best, they are doing a great work with most of their products and one can see the effort and love they put on the things they create, except the damn heart rate sensors! ;)"
LaCray ,"It does everthing I want it to, but it would work better for me if I could see the results if I could increase the font size. I don't wear my glasses all the time."
Squedas,"I love my Versa 3. This has been life changing for me to track everything in my day to daym from food and water, workouts to walks, my sleep patterns, and my blood sugars! This has been an intrigal part to getting my unified health back on track. The Versa data is linkable to health accounts, and is shareable amongst family. And the app features that you can add at little to no coat are also great!"
Squedas,"Love this Fitbit because it is simple to use.  I purchased an Apple Watch but returned it.  The Fitbit tracks sleep, number of steps walked, heart rate, weather, and sends text messages.  The Face is easy to read.  Love it."
J. Ochlek,Had outer Fitbit in the past and worked great unfortunately the newest one I have has a mojor issue with the weather app I was told that it was being worked on and 4 months later the temp is still 20 degree in Texas
J. Ochlek,i had the same watch but I ordered it through another party and not any replacemrnt bands would stay in place.
Oblio,I'm using this watch to help me train for a half marathon and it's exceeding expectations. I'm clumsy so I drop it a lot and it's very durable. The only thing I could complain about is that it's a little confusing to set up the apps on the watch. Would buy again!
B,"I've run this for 2 years before getting ocean water in it.  It stopped working and got really hot when I tried to charge it.  A couple weeks later it came to life again when I tried charging it again.  I already bought a replacement though.  Having this has given me the motivation to maintain a 10k step per day habit and I'm a lot healthier for it.  This is a high quality device with an app that gives you lots of data and motivation, even on the free tier."
L. Rice,a great device to help keep you up to date with your activity goals.
Jessica VanLinter,I am just getting used to it. As me in a month
Steamer@44,"The first one I received only worked for a week or two, they replaced it and haven't had any problems since."
Dorian S. Brigance,I love the watch( Versa 1 finally died). Hated the rubber watchband even though the design was way better on this one than a regular fitbit band.  I actually had skin pealing on the outside if my wrist and the small was too small and the large it came with was too big. Bought a different one on Amazon that I liked.
Annette Fortune,"I’m really enjoying this smart watch paired to my iPhone 12 mini. I love being notified of texts, etc. The sleep tracking is interesting. I like the step counter as well and the heart rate. I love being able to use Alexa! Overall really nice smart watch. I just wish I could use Amazon music with it. It will only allow Spotify or Pandora."
Jess,"Got this for my wife. Would be better if some features didn't require a premium subscription, but wife really likes it and it works as advertised. It won't answer calls, unless we haven't figured out how that works, but it will receive and send simple text. She's happy."
William T Sommerville,"Does everything that my Versa 2 did  and just a little more. Battery seems to last just shy of a week, no issues pairing it with my phone."
Gary A. Vaughan,The options on this watch are very close to my appleSE watch that I have. You can text on it and make calls . I prefer not to answer calls on it. I feel that they have not perfected that yet. The steps and heart rate and sleep Tracking work good. Texting needs work. Overall it is a good watch. It still does not meet Apple watch but for the price it is good.
Barb Houghton,Its a great product chargers kind of slow.
Lisa Gray,I got the Versa 3 to replace my 2 that had gone out. I like it alot. Great features and a longer battery life. The only thing I don't really like is the side press button. You have to press it exactly right for it to work. The regular click button on the 2 was easier.
Rosemarie Riley,"its good but, Dont know if its the phone app or the watch but a lot of things i see on app dont completely install on watch (sections missing, readings dont appear, things dont change with the app setting change). I've tried 3 weather apps, neither fully downloaded and watch screen just said downloding for two days. watch faces constantly missing features in desciptions and notifications are delayed if the come in.My main purpose was to use with dexcom g6, but apps are few and I dont think theres an official one.can only have 5 faces, the watch is actually cool just the band gets uncomfortable"
Rosemarie Riley,my fitbit is currently glitching out so heavily i cant use it anymore and the only out of ordinary thing i did was go to Yosemite and play in the snow so either snow/ice or high altitude got to it. ill find out the exact problem when i take it in to get fixed and update this review when i get proper diagnoses
B,"Update 3/23/21-Pros:GPS-I am happy to report that the GPS seems in line with other trackers and did not kill the battery.Make/receive calls & texts from the watch is very easy to useCons:For a touchscreen that is hard to wake by touch, water running down my arm in the shower seems to navigate the heck out of the menus. Odd.Messages don't seem to stay accessible after you have read the. So you can't refer back (unless I'm doing it wrong)Almost 2 years ago I decided I was interested in trying a smart watch.  So I purchased a VERY inexpensive one to see if it was really something that I'd want or if I'd feel TOO connected.  After using that for a while I was ready to bump up to a better, more functional watch.  Thus the Versa 3.Pros:Battery life is GREAT.  After initial charge, I didn't have to charge again until the end of day 5.  Though that was with minimal use of many features (none using the GPS) so I'll update eventually based upon more testing.  I also have not been using the 'always on' function of the screen which I'm sure would eat into it more.Built in GPS-which I have yet to put to the test but for one try.  Sadly even on a clear day it did take a long time to connect, but once it did it seemed to track fairly accurately.  Will update with more use.Screen is very bright and a really nice size.  They made great use of the landscape without having to make the watch any bigger really.Reminders for activity-this is nice where it keeps track of your heartrate all the time and provides more short term goals throughout the day rather than just ""did you hit your step goal for the entire day"".Cons:The touchscreen is difficult to wake up by touch.  You can set it to turn on from motion or be 'always on'.  But it takes a pretty solid tap to get it to wake without flipping my wrist over each time.The band-this has to be the WORST design concept in the history of watch bands.  You actually have to tuck the long piece through the claps UNDER the other half of the band (so up against your wrist).  Whomever came up with this idea must have lost a bet or something.  What makes this worse is that while like many other watches out there, you can find a bounty of 'compatible with' bands to choose from.  But almost all of them are of this same stupid design.  It just simply makes NO SENSE to me.Some others have complained about the lack of ability to store more faces, or to stream/store music, but honestly...neither of those are of any significant importance to me so I can't knock the watch for that.  I suppose that I would like to at some point stream my Amazon playlists, but for now it is not an issue.Overall I really like this watch and I was comparing against the Samsung Galaxy Active 2.  By all accounts that I can read and find-that one seems to be a more capable watch, but the battery barely lasts into the 2nd day, and what good is a great watch that you have to keep taking off to charge all the time?"
L. Rice,"First I am extremely impressed with this device. Enough to continue to ware my Apple Watch on one hand and the Fitbit Versa 3 on the other.  Please read the entire review, I explain why. Love the device and I highly recommend as an alternative, or addition to the Apple Watch.Pros:Nice screen sizeProvides more Health related data than my current Apple Watch Series 4.  For the series 6 this may not be true.Very well made, looks and feels great when properly adjusted to your wrist. (See Cons)True 6 day Battery life! (depending on use and activity level of course)Monitors your Heart rate constantly and oxygen saturation while sleepingMonitors your sleep - Lets yo see how long you were in each stage of sleepMotivates you with reminders so help you create healthier habits Like getting up and moving frequently and drinking more waterThe app provides great information for your daily activity such as Steps during the day, how many floors you traveled. Miles you walked in the day and how many calories you burned during the day.Love the screen that breaks down your cardio zone minutes.Will provide notifications to you from other apps on your phone.You can also use this watch to connect with Alexa and give voice commands to control any Alexa controlled devices thought the watch to the Fitbit Versa 3You can move the pairing of the fit bit from one device to another without loosing any collected data and without having to reset the watch!Easily connects to phone Via BluetoothThis Fitbit provides so much information if you are serious about being more healthy using this to track trends in your daily activity will definitely help you to improve.  If it had more functions I would use it to replace my Apple Watch.Very easy to use and get used too.Cons:its not an apple watch :-)You need to pay for an app to install additional watch faces.You do not get all functions when paired with an iPhone, there are additional functions availableYou can not accept phone calls with this device when paired with iPhone. This may be available with other smart phones.The watch band is very similar to the Apple Watch band but is harder to put on and take off with a single hand.  Be sure to use the correct size band, it comes with a regular and large band.  if you use the incorrect one it may pinch or irritate your skin.  Once I put on the large band it was very comfortable.Conclusion:The Pro's  far out weight the cons with me. I will not use this to replace my Apple Watch however I will continue to use both.  I do wish I had a single device that would provide all the functions that the combination of my Apple Watch 4 (I will not upgrade at this time) and this Fitbit Versa 3 provide.  The price for what you are getting is not bad but still may be a bit much for the average person.  If you are serious about your health and really would like a great device that will provide you with additional information that an Apple Watch will not, I highly recommend this device."
Bearskate,"(Disclaimer, this is my first fitbit device)The major problems I have been having (in a nutshell) are with the battery and the apps.I've only had this watch for 2 days and only used it for 1. When I received the device I followed the instructions inside the box for set up/charging. I plugged the watch in to the charger and let it charge while I set up the device. Once the watch was at 100% battery I removed it from the charger and within the first few minutes it went from 100% down to 98%, not a super big deal, but kind of strange considering it's supposed to have 6 days of battery life. This all happened in the evening around 8 pm yesterday. By the next morning the watch was at 70 or 80 something percent and continued to drain rapidly throughout the day (the always-on-display was turned off, btw). So, this watch definitely does not have 6 days of battery life, at least mine doesn't.Secondly, I spent a good deal of time last evening (while the watch was charging) setting up my watch, widgets, and the Fitbit app. The the thing I spent a decent amount of time on was the weather app (again, I am new to the fitbit world, so it took me a little bit to navigate). I spent quite a bit of time trying to set up this weather thing and got it to work, but the very next day (when I was actually using the watch) it stopped working. It kept saying I needed to set up the app, but I already did, and I double checked multiple times to make sure that my cities were set up and in the order that I wanted them in. I double checked my settings/permissions, my location, watched two or three YouTube videos, turned the watch off and on again, etc, and it still is not working.The watch also counted steps while I was driving (so not super accurate), and counted normal steps as flights of stairs sometimes (it said I climbed 10+ in a few hours and I only climbed maybe 4 or 5?). To be fair, I was wearing heels so maybe that had something to do with it?In any case, this device is not worth all the hype. I probably just should've bought a Samsung watch or something instead. I will continue to use the device since I bought it, but I'm probably not going to be singing its praises anytime soon. I am still willing to give it a chance and hoping the issues will get worked out, but as I stand right now I would not recommend this device to anyone."
Bearskate,"Love everything about it, except the “sensor” side button. It’s hit or miss or miss or miss or hit. I preferred the actual button on the versa 2. The app is fantastic, From the get-go I check it just about daily … since 2019 ?? I like getting a new because I do wear them out.  Still a big fan !"
Frederick Baudrau,"I use this not just to track exercise and daily steps it sleep, menstrual cycle (it is VERY accurate!), water intake. And meals. I’ve learned a lot about my sleep patterns and I’ve been motivated to work harder to hit those goals. I also love that it shows texts so I can easily see if it’s something I need to interrupt what I’m working on to check on. I’ve worn this everyday for well over a year and use the same band. While it is starting to show wear on the band it isn’t noticeable unless you really look at it in the light. Not something just anyone would notice. I do keep a screen protector on it. The one I use is just some cheapo but it does the job and the screen is in perfect like new condition regardless of how often I bump into counter and desk edges and doorways (maybe I’m a little clumsy). I have gotten it wet with no issues. I believe it can be worn while swimming but I haven’t tried it myself."
Kindle Customer,"This is a replacement for my first Versa 3. It was used hard. The only time it left my wrist was when it was charging. It experienced serious adversity and in the end, it was the processor that died...two months after the warranty expired. The Versa 4 costs more and lost features. I'll get a newer model when this one dies."
Christine,"This was an upgrade for me - and I am so disappointed with the sleep tracking feature.  I've noticed inaccuracies on the sleep tracking feature, but this morning took the cake.  I woke up around 830, fixed a cup of coffee, got dressed, made my bed, did a load of laundry, dialed in to listen to my Sunday morning church service, fixed breakfast all before 1030 and the sleep tracking feature says I never woke up until 1041.  Also, I go upstairs to visit my daughter several times a week and 5 out of 7 trips up and down the steps are not recognized on the floors feature - but a walk to the mailbox is counts as a ""floor"" - so now i wonder how many other features are faulty - not a happy camper"
Kandice Sulser,Love the bands and everything about my fitbit.
Deandra V.,I've gotten used to using my fitbit during daily exercise and to track my sleep. The 4 stars is because there is no button! It's been replaced by a hit or miss system of tapping or covering a slot. which is frustrating!
tanecl (xbox tag),"From the very start of my husband purchasing this Fitbit Smart watch/fitness tracker from Amazon, for my birthday (he ended up giving it to me early) I've  had problems with the molded band.  After a week or so I noticed a rash developing under the band, all the way around my wrist.  I tried putting tissue under the band, etc to keep the band from coming into contact with my skin.  After a week of frustration with this method, not working, I realized I might be allergic to the band.  So I started looking for a hypoallergenic band.  I found a pretty faux pink leather band and ordered it, also from Amazon.  My husband put the new band on.  At first, it seemed to take care of my skin issue but within 30 minutes one side of the band fell out of the holder.  My husband tried and tried to reattach the band without success.  I now decided I needed to go to another big box store and purchase a leather band, thinking the pink faux band was inferior.  Within 30 minutes of the store staff member installing it for me.  This one fell off, too; became unattached.  I return to the store right away and the clerk told me that my particular fitbit smartwatch/tracker was of inferior quality and that I should return it to my original store of purchase.Note:  I have been wearing one style or another of Fitbit smartwatch/tracking devices, since 2014.  I have always used with the original composite bands and Never had an issue before this time.  My husband also wears a Fitbit product because Fitbit always stands behind their product.  I'm extremely frustrated, that because I bought this product in late August, Amazon will not replace it.  If I had purchased it now they would replace an inferior product up to and including January 31, 2023.  We will never purchase from this vendor again in the future, as they won't stand behind their product.  We still believe that Fitbit makes a superior product, over the competing brands.  I'm extremely disappointed!!"
elijah chavarria,"Good watch, the only thing I don't like is I have to charge it like every week.  It is a great fitness watch and recommend to anyone."
Johnnym,My wife uses for work all day. Battery lasts three to five days of full charge.
Al Tone,I DISLIKE the button to turn it off/on.It doesn’t work properly
Al Tone,Can see it in daylight
B,I don’t think the Versa 3 is as user friendly as the earlier versions.
L. Rice,"I had an older model Fitbit watch and, frankly, it was pretty plain and boring! Although it looked nice on my wrist with the metal band, the display characters were too small to read well, I couldn’t see anything in the sunlight and the available apps were few. The Versa 3 changed all of that for me! It was easy to set up and configure. I can easily read most any display that is available (and there are a lot!) – in sunlight, under clouds, at night in the dark, under any conditions! Although I didn’t think I was going to take advantage of the many fitness apps and features the tracker has to offer, that has turned out to be the biggest reason I like the watch/tracker! It has proven to be very accurate when compared to my iPhone walking app! Distance, pace, elapsed time, steps all compare accurately. And it even monitors the number of hours I actually sleep at night (how does it know!?) and at what levels of sleep; all very accurate. It also gives me a snapshot of my heart performance (BPM, irregular heart rate/rhythms). The only downside is the GPS loses connectivity when I walk under a steel/concrete bridge! That doesn’t happen with my iPhone! I like the instant text messaging from my iPhone, too. I don’t have to find my iPhone when I get a text to read it; it pops up on my watch! The flexibility of changing watch faces and behaviors is great, too! There are also a lot of ‘add-ons’ I’m able to take advantage of too (protective face covers, a variety of bands/materials, charger options). This has really proven to add value to many aspects of my daily activities; and helped me to better manage my health! Never thought I’d find a ‘watch/tracker’ so valuable!"
Bilbo Maggins,"Very light weight and did everything I wanted. Because I have an iPhone, some of the features do not work with iPhones (quick response to text, Alexa and google asst). Another thing that bothered me quite a bit was that the side button (which is not a button) does not respond very well. Most times I had to use quite a bit of force with my squeeze to get the button to work and this was very annoying. But overall, it was a nice watch. I wish versa 3 had an actual button like versa 4. And if you are wondering why I chose versa 3 instead then do some YouTube reviews on these two items. There are missing features on the versa 4 that versa 3 had."
Dan M,I like everything except not crazy about the band but trying to get used to it.
Kikaboo!,In love with my fit bit
K. Mundhenk,I dislike that I have to always connect to my phone and I can’t answer my phone with it and I love that I can track my steps and food intake
elf,A great watch. No major complaints.
Sissy,Good choice of apps (free). Standalone Wifi is missing for Wi-Fi calling
